REUTERS/Eduardo MunozFollowing a slump of almost a third between Feb. 19 and March 23, the tech-heavy index has rebounded over 30%, driven by strong gains in Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and other so called \"stay-at-home\" stocks. “Everything else has been so bad that tech is now seen as a safe-haven,” said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC. “It’s like we’re back in 1999, where if you had a website, you were hot. Now, if you specialize in selling online, you’re hot.”(GRAPHIC-Nasdaq erases coronavirus losses link: )Thursday's 1.5% Nasdaq rally was fueled by a nearly 14% leap in PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O after the payments processor delivered an upbeat outlook as the health crisis drives more people to shop online.The Nasdaq was on track to end the session up about 0.1% year to date.A surprise rise in Chinese exports raised hopes of a faster economic recovery from what is expected to be a deep coronavirus-led recession, lifting stocks across Wall Street.The Nasdaq’s recent strong performance leaves it down about 8% from its February record high, just before fears of the coronavirus put an end to an 11-year bull market. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 remains down 14% from its record high, and the Dow is down 19% from its peak.The Nasdaq has gained about 13% over the past 12 months. It has little exposure to oil stocks, which have been a drag on the S&amp;P 500 as demand for crude evaporates due to the slump in economic activity caused by the coronavirus.(GRAPHIC-Amazon and Microsoft fuel Nasdaq gains link: )With people shopping from home due to orders to remain at home and avoid stores, Amazon has surged 9% since late February. After hitting a record high a week ago, it lost ground after warning it could post a quarterly loss due to heavy spending in response to the pandemic.Microsoft, Wall Street’s most valuable company, on Thursday rose 0.5%. It has been helped recently by increased use of its Teams chat and online meeting app and Xbox gaming services.Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Lisa ShumakerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

It also affects third-party merchants who have come to depend on Amazon’s platform for revenue.Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Maju SamuelOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

The remaining 50,000 workers it has brought on will stay on seasonal contracts that last up to 11 months, a company spokeswoman said.The decision is a sign that Amazon’s sales have increased sufficiently to justify an expanded workforce for order fulfillment, even as government lockdowns ease and rivals open their retail stores for pickup.Amazon started the hiring spree in March with a blog post appealing to workers laid off by restaurants and other shuttered businesses, promising employment “until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back.”Seattle-based Amazon did not disclose how much it was spending to make the positions permanent and whether that cost would be in addition to the $4 billion it has forecast for virus-related expenses.The permanent roles come with benefits that seasonal workers lack, such as employer-offered health insurance and retirement plans.Some Amazon staff, unions and elected officials have said the company has put employees’ health at risk by keeping nearly all its warehouses operational during the pandemic. At least 800 U.S.-based workers have tested positive for the highly contagious virus, according to figures compiled by one employee, which Amazon has not commented on.The company has increased cleaning, added social distancing measures and offered face masks, fever checks and virus tests in response.Amazon said it had 840,400 full and part-time staff at the end of last quarter while it still was in the process of hiring.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File PhotoThe complaint was filed on Wednesday in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, by three employees of the JFK8 fulfillment center in Staten Island, and by family members.One employee, Barbara Chandler, said she tested positive for COVID-19 in March and later saw several household members become sick, including a cousin who died on April 7.The lawsuit said Amazon has made JFK8, which employs about 5,000, a “place of danger” by impeding efforts to stop the coronavirus spreading, boosting productivity at the expense of safety.It said Amazon forces employees to work at “dizzying speeds, even if doing so prevents them from socially distancing, washing their hands, and sanitizing their work spaces.”Amazon did not comment on the lawsuit, but said it has always followed guidance from health authorities and its workplace safety experts since the coronavirus pandemic began.The Seattle-based company has benefited as the pandemic forced many consumers unable to visit physical stores to shop online more.Unions, elected officials and some employees have faulted Amazon’s treatment of workers, including the firing of some critical of warehouse conditions.Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said last week that Amazon has not fired people for such criticism.Amazon is spending more than $800 million on coronavirus safety in this year’s first half, including cleaning, temperature checks and face masks.At least 800 workers in U.S. distribution centers have tested positive for COVID-19, according to an employee’s unofficial tally.Amazon ended 2019 with 798,000 full- and part-time employees.The lawsuit seeks an injunction requiring that Amazon comply with worker safety and public nuisance laws, and not punish employees who develop COVID-19 symptoms or are quarantined.The case is Palmer et al v Amazon.com Inc., U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 20-02468.Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Additional reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Tom Brown and Grant McCoolOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

              "      <td>- Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday launched a website for shoppers in Saudi Arabia, showing its continued business interests there despite a public dispute between Riyadh and the company’s chief executive, Jeff Bezos.The website is a re-branding for Saudi customers of Souq.com, a Middle East e-commerce platform that Amazon acquired in 2017. Shoppers’ account information with Souq automatically transferred to the new address, amazon.sa, Amazon said on the site. The company similarly converted Souq’s website in the United Arab Emirates to a re-branded portal, amazon.ae, last year.The news indicates that a conflict involving Bezos and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has not derailed Amazon’s investment plans for the kingdom. In a press release, Amazon said it is building an operations network that will span the country, and its footprint already includes 14 warehouses, a workforce of more than 1,400 and a strategic delivery partnership with Saudi Post.The publication of leaked text messages between Bezos and his girlfriend in early 2019 kicked off a dispute between the world’s richest man and Saudi Arabia. Bezos’ security chief last year said the kingdom was the source of the messages, and in January, United Nations experts said they had information pointing to the “possible involvement” of Crown Prince Mohammed in an alleged plot to hack Bezos’ phone. Saudi Arabia called the suggestion “absurd.”Bezos privately owns the Washington Post, which employed Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi columnist and critic of the crown prince who was murdered in October 2018. The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency believes Crown Prince Mohammed ordered the killing, sources previously told Reuters, while the crown prince last year denied the claim and said rogue operatives carried out the act.The saga had fueled speculation that Amazon would pull back from doing business in the country.Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Cynthia OstermanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/PJ HuffstutterThe world's largest online retailer ordered more than 2,200 heavy-duty Utilimaster \"walk-in\" delivery trucks from Shyft Group SHYF.O, a Michigan-based specialty vehicle company, an Amazon spokeswoman told Reuters. The company declined to say how many of the vehicles have been sent to Amazon delivery contractors, or where they would be deployed.Amazon is under pressure to make good on one- and two-day deliveries promised to customers who subscribe to its $119 annual Prime service. Orders for food, computers, toys and exercise equipment surged after states issued stay-at-home orders to battle the pandemic, overwhelming Amazon’s network and adding days and even weeks to delivery times.Drivers assigned to the new trucks showed Reuters training materials from Wisconsin-based safety and compliance consultancy J.J. Keller &amp; Associates, which confirmed that Amazon is a client. The Shyft Group did not respond to requests for comment.One of the new Amazon trucks was seen recently operating in Chicago, according to a Reuters reporter. Training is under way in the Los Angeles area, drivers said.While Amazon purchased the vehicles last year, the branded trucks have been parked for months in locations around the United States, including in Amazon lots in New Jersey and California dairy country. The company declined to state why it waited so long to roll out the new fleet.Drivers familiar with the new vehicles said they can carry more and bigger packages than the Mercedes-Benz DAIGn.DE, Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI, and Ford Motor Co F.N vans Amazon contractors dispatch around the country.Two drivers, who declined to be named for fear of retaliation, opted not to switch to the new vehicles because they are heavier and more difficult to maneuver than Amazon vans.Amazon came under fire last year after ProPublica, BuzzFeed and other news outlets reported on Amazon’s training practices and van accidents that resulted in injuries and deaths. Amazon said in an email Friday that van drivers must undergo training that includes two days of classroom instruction and two days of ride-alongs with experienced drivers.Amazon suspended its upstart Amazon Shipping program for non-Amazon packages in June to prioritize deliveries to its own customers.Amazon declined to say whether the new fleet would be used to restart that service, which competes directly with UPS and FedEx.Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and PJ Huffstutter in Chicago; Editing by Nick Zieminski and David GregorioOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

              "      <td>- Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Thursday posted the biggest profit in its 26-year history as online sales and its lucrative business supporting third-party merchants surged during the coronavirus pandemic.Shares of Amazon, the world’s largest online retailer, rose 5% in after-hours trade.While rival brick-and-mortar retailers have had to shut stores during government-imposed lockdowns, Amazon hired 175,000 people in recent months and saw demand for its services soar. The company said revenue jumped 40% from a year earlier to $88.9 billion.Amazon had forecast it might lose money in the just-ended second quarter because it expected to spend some $4 billion on protective equipment for staff and other expenses related to COVID-19. It did just that - and still earned $5.2 billion - double its net income from a year prior.Jeff Bezos, who founded the company in July 1994 and is the world’s richest person, said in a statement, “This was another highly unusual quarter.”Amazon’s shares have risen by more than 60% this year, adding to the wealth of Bezos, its biggest stockholder. The S&amp;P 500 is virtually flat.Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, said Amazon’s business model sets it up “to expand its e-commerce dominance even more broadly as the global COVID-19 pandemic continues to flare.”Online store sales jumped 48% to $45.9 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile, merchants paid Amazon more to fulfill and sponsor their products in order to reach the company’s loyal customers. That resulted in a 52% and 41% jump in seller services revenue and other revenue such as from ads, respectively.Amazon’s cloud services also saw higher demand as companies switched to virtual offices in the pandemic. Revenue from Amazon Web Services (AWS), which sells data storage and computing power in the cloud, rose nearly 29% to $10.81 billion.FILE PHOTO: An Amazon sign stands in a parking lot outside of an Amazon warehouse as the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues in the Staten Island borough of New York U.S., May 1, 2020. REUTERS/Lucas JacksonStill, that fell just short of analysts' estimates of $10.95 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The cloud business of rival Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google meanwhile was up over 43% year over year.Technology analyst Patrick Moorhead said, “AWS continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate than last quarter.”‘EVERYONE WAS BUYING GROCERIES’Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer, told reporters that the outsized profit surprised the company because at the time it issued its forecast last quarter, shoppers were buying lower-margin products.“Everyone was looking for masks; everyone was looking for gloves; everyone was buying groceries online. That mix is not super profitable,” he said. “What we saw in Q2 was not only did the mix start to shift back to a more normal mix” but that “we also were able to ship a lot more than we had originally thought.”Online grocery sales tripled year over year, and worldwide streaming video hours doubled, Olsavsky said on a call with analysts. Delivery and video services bundled with the company’s loyalty club Prime are a key reason why customers subscribe to that program and do more of their shopping on Amazon.Amazon also posted a rare operating profit in its international business, which Olsavsky attributed to a step up in customer spending in Europe and Japan during the pandemic.The company forecast net sales of $87 billion to $93 billion for the third quarter, ahead of analysts’ expectations of $86.34 billion, according to IBES data.Olsavsky said that Prime Day, the company’s lucrative summer marketing blitz, would be pushed back to the fourth quarter, excluding its business in India. He also said that per usual the current quarter would see higher costs as the company gears up for the holiday season, even more pronounced now due to higher-than-usual sales.It would spend more than $2 billion in COVID-related expenses during the third quarter as well, he said on the analyst call.Still, Amazon anticipates operating profit between $2 billion and $5 billion for the quarter, the midpoint of which is higher than analysts were expecting, according to research firm FactSet.Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Anil D’Silva and Grant McCoolOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Kevin Mohatt/File Photo  Swedish customers can already shop on Amazon through its websites in other European countries such as Germany, and get their purchases shipped to the country, but this often meant paying high delivery charges.“We are optimistic that, by focusing on the things we believe customers will place the greatest emphasis on - low prices, a wide range and fast deliveries - we will eventually be able to win the trust of Swedish customers,” Alex Ootes, vice president for EU Expansion at Amazon, said on Tuesday,The Swedish website amazon.se was still directing customers to amazon.de with an option to deliver to Sweden. Amazon has not released a date for the launch of the website, a spokesman said.Amazon did not say if it would create a warehouse or distribution hub in Sweden but Ootes said: “The next step is to introduce a complete retail offering in Sweden and that is what we plan to do now”.Logistics group Kuehne and Nagel told Reuters it was building a contract logistics facility in Eskilstuna, about 100 km west of Sweden’s capital Stockholm.The probable entry of Amazon into Sweden has been talked about for years and could represent a challenge to local players.Daniel Ovin, senior analyst at Nordea, said that based on a report written in October autoparts, sporting goods and general merchandise would be the most exposed sectors after an Amazon entry in the Nordics.Ovin added that retailers in United States, Britain, Germany and France that have adopted successful strategies to meet the challenge from Amazon have turned to premium products, sharpened their delivery mechanisms, increased private labels or added brands that were not sold on Amazon.Shares of budget DIY and homewares retailer Clas Ohlson, fashion specialist Boozt AB, and e-books seller Storytel edged lower.Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee and Simon Johnson in Stockholm, with Tommy Lund in Gdansk; Editing by David Holmes and David EvansOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

              "      <td>- Amazon.com can be held liable like other traditional retailers for injuries from defective products sold via its sprawling e-commerce marketplace, a California state appeals court ruled on Thursday.The decision overturned a San Diego Superior Court ruling that the world’s biggest online retailer was shielded from liability because it acted as a service provider, which is not subject to California product liability law.In addition to selling its own inventory, Amazon allows third-party vendors to list products for sale on its website. Such vendors may store their products in Amazon’s warehouses or ship them directly to customers.The appeals court found that Amazon played a pivotal role in every step of plaintiff Angela Bolger’s purchase of a replacement laptop battery from Amazon third-party seller Lenoge Technology HK Ltd, which was operating under the fictitious name “E-Life.” Bolger alleged that the battery burst into flames while she balanced the laptop on her thighs, resulting in severe burns to her arms, legs and feet.“Whatever term we use to describe Amazon’s role, be it ‘retailer,’ ‘distributor,’ or merely ‘facilitator,’ it was pivotal in bringing the product here to the consumer,” the appeals court held.Amazon has faced multiple lawsuits seeking to hold it responsible for damage or injuries caused by defective products sold by third parties, including ones based overseas in China, with most courts concluding it is not a “seller” under various states’ product liability laws. But a few rulings have gone the other way and have allowed Amazon to be sued.Both Pennsylvania’s and Ohio’s top courts are currently considering the issue, and federal appeals courts are weighing cases under California and Texas law.The case decided on Thursday drew friend-of-the-court briefs from plaintiff lawyer groups and corporate groups.The ruling comes as California lawmakers weigh legislation that would put Amazon and other operators of online marketplaces on equal footing under the state’s strict liability law.Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Greg Mitchell and Dan GreblerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

              "      <td>- Amazon.com Inc is in preliminary talks to invest in U.S. cloud services provider Rackspace Technology Inc, people familiar with the discussion said on Monday.The deal would involve Amazon acquiring a minority stake in Rackspace, the sources said. Rackspace helps companies migrate their data to Amazon Web Services, and the investment would strengthen the ties between the two companies. Rackspace also migrates companies to Alphabet Inc’s Google Cloud, Microsoft Corp’s Azure and VMware Inc.There is no certainty that Amazon and Rackspace, which is majority-owned by private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc, will agree a deal, the sources said. If there is one, it could take one to two months to negotiate it, the sourced added, asking anonymity because the matter is confidential.Rackspace and Apollo declined to comment, while Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.Rackspace leases server space and helps corporations store and access data in the cloud. It was acquired by Apollo in a $4.3 leveraged buyout in 2016, and was listed in the stock market earlier this month. The San Antonio, Texas-based company has market capitalization of more than $3 billion, almost as much as its debt pile.Amazon’s cloud services is thriving on higher demand from companies switching to virtual offices amid the coronavirus outbreak. Its revenue from Amazon Web Services, which sells data storage and computing power in the cloud, rose nearly 29% in the second quarter to $10.81 billion.If Rackspace bring in Amazon as an investor, it would be the second Apollo-owned company to secure such a deal with a major technology company this year.Earlier this month, Google revealed it had picked up a 6.6% stake in ADT Inc for $450 million, betting on the home security company’s strong customer base and an army of technicians to drive sales of its Nest devices.Apollo had acquired ADT in a nearly $7 billion deal in 2016, and still owns a majority stake in the company. ADT shares have risen in value by more than a third since the deal with Google was announced.

REUTERS/Pascal RossignolA majority of the electric vehicles from Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE car and vans division will go into service this year, the company said, adding that it had ordered 1,200 of Mercedes-Benz's larger eSprinter models and 600 of the midsize eVitos.The order is the largest for Mercedes-Benz’s electric vehicles to date and includes 800 vans for Germany and 500 for the United Kingdom.It is dwarfed, however, by Amazon’s recent order for 100,000 electric delivery vans from Rivian Automotive LLC, a startup it has invested in.Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in a statement the Daimler agreement was part of the retailer’s “journey to build the most sustainable transportation fleet in the world.”Mercedes-Benz on Friday joined The Climate Pledge, started by Amazon last year, which calls on signatories to be net zero carbon across their businesses by 2040. The automaker has previously said it was aiming to have a carbon neutral fleet by 2039.In 2018, Amazon became the biggest customer of Mercedes’ non-electric Sprinter vans, securing 20,000 vehicles for delivery contractors.“Moving forward, we are prioritizing the addition of electric vehicles,” Ross Rachey, Amazon’s director of global fleet and products for last-mile delivery told Reuters.Other delivery companies are pushing for more electric fleets. In January United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N said it was ordering 10,000 delivery trucks from UK-based Arrival Ltd.Daimler's rivals are also working on bringing electric vans to market. Ford Motor Co F.N plans an all-electric version of its Transit van in North America in 2022, and General Motors Co GM.N aims to start production of an electric van in late 2021.Reporting by Nick Carey; Editing by Tom BrownOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Eduardo MunozFollowing a slump of almost a third between Feb. 19 and March 23, the tech-heavy index has rebounded over 30%, driven by strong gains in Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and other so called \"stay-at-home\" stocks. “Everything else has been so bad that tech is now seen as a safe-haven,” said Dennis Dick, a trader at Bright Trading LLC. “It’s like we’re back in 1999, where if you had a website, you were hot. Now, if you specialize in selling online, you’re hot.”(GRAPHIC-Nasdaq erases coronavirus losses link: )Thursday's 1.5% Nasdaq rally was fueled by a nearly 14% leap in PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O after the payments processor delivered an upbeat outlook as the health crisis drives more people to shop online.The Nasdaq was on track to end the session up about 0.1% year to date.A surprise rise in Chinese exports raised hopes of a faster economic recovery from what is expected to be a deep coronavirus-led recession, lifting stocks across Wall Street.The Nasdaq’s recent strong performance leaves it down about 8% from its February record high, just before fears of the coronavirus put an end to an 11-year bull market. By comparison, the S&amp;P 500 remains down 14% from its record high, and the Dow is down 19% from its peak.The Nasdaq has gained about 13% over the past 12 months. It has little exposure to oil stocks, which have been a drag on the S&amp;P 500 as demand for crude evaporates due to the slump in economic activity caused by the coronavirus.(GRAPHIC-Amazon and Microsoft fuel Nasdaq gains link: )With people shopping from home due to orders to remain at home and avoid stores, Amazon has surged 9% since late February. After hitting a record high a week ago, it lost ground after warning it could post a quarterly loss due to heavy spending in response to the pandemic.Microsoft, Wall Street’s most valuable company, on Thursday rose 0.5%. It has been helped recently by increased use of its Teams chat and online meeting app and Xbox gaming services.Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Lisa ShumakerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

It also affects third-party merchants who have come to depend on Amazon’s platform for revenue.Reporting by Akanksha Rana in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Maju SamuelOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",
