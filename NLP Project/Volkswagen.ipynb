REUTERS/China DailyAuthorities have restricted access to areas affected by the Aug. 12 blasts at a hazardous chemicals warehouse which killed at least 114 people. Automakers are struggling to reach lots and warehouses to assess damage and clear thousands of charred cars to make facilities usable, though the port continues to operate.On Wednesday, Renault SA RENA.PA and Subaru maker Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd 7270.T said they would re-route imports to Shanghai, while Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS said it would send further shipments to Shanghai and Guangzhou.Toyota is considering re-routing imports to Shanghai and Dalian which have enough capacity to prevent any significant logistical problems, a senior Beijing-based executive said.“Port of Tianjin will likely be unusable for a long while, although I have no idea at the moment how long these disruptions would last,” said the executive, who was not authorised to speak with media on the matter and so declined to be identified.Toyota suspended its two final assembly lines near Tianjin port on Monday to Wednesday, partly to assess any damage. It made 432,340 cars at the plants last year, and is likely to lose 2,200 a day due to the blasts, said researcher IHS Automotive.A Toyota spokesman in Japan said, without elaborating, that the automaker was looking to re-route shipments to other ports.SHANGHAITianjin, regarded as a gateway to China’s industrial northeast, handles 40 percent of car imports in the world’s biggest auto market. But the explosions are likely to hamper normal operations for at least a couple of months, said IHS.On Monday, BMW AG BMWG.DE said it would re-route shipments to Shanghai, while Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE opted for both Shanghai and Guangzhou.Shanghai’s sole auto terminal could see a 10 percent rise in car volume based on queries received since the Tianjin blast, said a marketing official at Shanghai Haitong International Automotive Terminal Co Ltd.The port has an annual capacity of 2 million to 3 million cars, said the official, who declined to be identified. Last year, China imported 1.4 million cars, customs data showed.“We’re only a temporary solution to the difficulties in Tianjin,” the official said. “We can’t be a substitute for Tianjin. After this, Tianjin will definitely continue to hold on to its dominant position.”Reporting by Norihiko Shirouzu and Jake Spring; Additional reporting by Minami Funakoshi; Editing by Edwina Gibbs and Christopher CushingOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

Hans Dieter Poetsch, CFO of German carmaker Volkswagen, adjusts his glasses during a news conference in Wolfsburg, July 5, 2012. REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer The company has been looking for a permanent successor to Piech, who was turfed out in April after clashing with Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn over strategy but still wields influence through his family holding.One day after proposing to extend the CEO’s contract by two years until the end of 2018, the supervisory board’s executive and nomination committees on Thursday proposed to elect Poetsch, 64, as chairman.Volkswagen's 51-percent owner Porsche Automobil Holding SE PSHG_p.DE said Poetsch had the unequivocal support of its supervisory board - which includes Piech. Winterkorn also supported the move to elevate Poetsch, according to a source familiar with the company's thinking.“This is good news,” said Arndt Ellinghorst of research firm Evercore ISI, citing Poetsch’s clear understanding of VW’s financial problems. “Poetsch has been advocating an increased focus on consolidating VW’s business post an era of M&amp;A.”VW’s plans to appoint Poetsch, who has been the German group’s finance chief since 2003, to the helm of its 20-member board were reported earlier on Thursday by Reuters.Shares in Volkswagen rose on the news, trading up 2.7 percent at 167.50 euros by 1506 GMT but still underperforming a 3.2 percent-stronger German DAX .GDAXI.Wolfsburg-based Volkswagen chose an internal candidate who understands the complexities of the relationship between labor unions, investors, major shareholder Lower Saxony and the Porsche-Piech clan.Appointing an external chairman would have caused more unrest than stability, according to the source familiar with the company’s thinking.“Everybody at VW believes firmly that the current problems can be overcome on our own,” the source said.Poetsch is likely to be elected for a full five-year term - even though he is replacing Piech whose board mandate officially expires in April 2017, a source at VW said.This would represent a break from tradition for the company, as a new board member usually serves out the remaining term of his predecessor before a new election takes place.If Poetsch were to serve out his full term, that would effectively put an end to 68-year-old Winterkorn’s ambitions of becoming chairman himself, earning a belated victory for Piech who had pledged to thwart the CEO’s chances of succeeding him.However, any success by Winterkorn in turning VW around could nevertheless bolster his chances of nudging the new man out and becoming chairman himself.Poetsch will first have to be elected to the supervisory board at an extraordinary shareholder meeting in November, which will also have to approve the appointment to the board of Piech’s niece, Louise Kiesling.Huber said the supervisory board would decide on a successor for Poetsch as CFO without delay.The chief executive of VW’s premium carmaker Audi, 52-year-old Rupert Stadler, is a candidate to succeed Poetsch as VW CFO, a source familiar with the matter said.Additional reporting by Edward Taylor and Jan Schwartz; Editing by Georgina Prodhan and Pravin CharOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

              "      <td>- Toyota Motor Corp is collaborating with two top U.S. universities on artificial intelligence and robotics research aimed at ramping up the Japanese automaker’s efforts to develop self-driving cars.Toyota said on Friday that it would spend $50 million over the next five years to establish joint research centers at both universities, one in the heart of Silicon Valley and the other outside Boston.Both schools have top-tier engineering and computer science programs, and the auto industry heavily recruits graduates of both.Toyota has lagged behind rivals in developing self-driving cars and implementing hands-free driver assistance systems.U.S. electric car maker Tesla Motors Inc already is doing final road-testing of a semi-automated hands-free system on its Model S sedan and plans to make it available to customers later this year.General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and Nissan Motor Co all have announced plans to phase in hands-free systems over the next two years. GM has a longstanding research partnership on self-driving vehicles with Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Mellon University. VW sponsors an intelligent-vehicle laboratory at Stanford. And Nissan earlier this year formed a partnership with the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley to conduct automated vehicle research.Toyota said it had hired Gill Pratt to direct its new research centers. Pratt is a former program manager at the U.S. Defense Department’s DARPA research arm, which has sponsored several self-driving vehicle challenges over the past 10 years. A team from Stanford won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge.Toyota was one of the first automakers to offer an automated parking system, on the Prius hybrid in Japan in 2003. But it has been slower than many of its competitors in implementing more advanced hands-free automated systems, and its executives have said the company has no intention of building a fully automated vehicle.Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Lisa Von AhnOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

There are 482,000 four-cylinder VW and Audi diesel cars sold since 2008 involved in the allegations. If each car involved is found to be in noncompliance, the penalty could be $18 billion, an EPA official confirmed on the teleconference.A U.S. Volkswagen spokesman said the company “is cooperating with the investigation; we are unable to comment further at this time.”The feature in question, which the EPA called a “defeat device,” masks the true emissions only during testing and therefore when the cars are on the road they emit as much as 40 times the level of pollutants allowed under clean air rules meant to ensure public health is protected, Giles said.The EPA accused Volkswagen of using software in four-cylinder Volkswagen and Audi diesel cars from model years 2009 to 2015 made to circumvent emissions testing of certain air pollutants.The cars are not facing recall at this time, the EPA said. VW did not indicate on Friday how it will address the issue.The EPA has the authority to order VW to recall the vehicles. However, that process could take up to a year, depending on the complexity of the issue, an EPA official said.The diesel-powered vehicles involved from the 2009 to 2015 model years are the VW Jetta, VW Beetle, VW Golf and the Audi A3, as well as the VW Passat from model years 2014 and 2015.VW in North America has heavily marketed its vehicles as being “clean diesel.”In a television commercial that has aired frequently this year in the United States, VW says it is the “No. 1 diesel car brand in America,” brags its cars are “clean diesel” and asks viewers, “Isn’t it time for German engineering?”Since 2009, diesel vehicles have made up approximately 15 percent of VW and Audi U.S. sales.Additional reporting by Patrick Rucker in Washington and Paul Lienert in DetroitOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

              "      <td>- When the International Council for Clean Transportation (ICCT) commissioned researchers at West Virginia University to test diesel car emissions in 2013, the group expected to find that diesel cars sold in the U.S. emitted fewer pollutants than cars sold elsewhere because they had to meet tougher standards, ICCT officials told Reuters on Monday.Instead, after testing a 2012 Volkswagen Jetta and a 2013 VW Passat, researchers were “surprised” when the results showed the opposite: the two VW models displayed much higher levels of nitrogen oxide emissions than permitted by law, while a third test vehicle, a BMW X5, generally fell within permissible limits.“Our hypothesis was these cars would all come out clean,” said Drew Kodjak, executive director of the ICCT, a non-profit independent research group with offices in Washington, San Francisco and Berlin.In May 2014, ICCT alerted the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board about their findings. On Friday, EPA said VW could be liable for up to $18 billion in penalties for using software on almost 500,000 VW and Audi diesel cars that circumvented emissions regulations, unleashing a controversy that threatens long-term damage to VW’s finances, leadership and reputation.VW shares in Europe fell almost 20 percent on Monday, and the company suspended U.S. sales of its diesel cars until it can come up with a fix to satisfy regulators. The disclosure comes as VW’s U.S. sales have lagged the company’s performance in other global markets, and could hamper its efforts to boost demand in the American market.Industry experts said the scandal could hit VW hard, just as it was emerging from a damaging leadership battle. VW Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn said on Sunday he was “deeply sorry” for the breach of U.S. rules and ordered an investigation. People including a VW supervisory board member said Winterkorn may have to resign.The concerns raised by ICCT “prompted CARB to start an investigation and discussions” with VW in 2014, CARB said. Nitrogen oxide emissions have been linked to smog and acid rain.VW agreed to conduct its own tests to replicate the ICCT study, proposed a software fix to CARB.‘CLEAN DIESEL’VW has been airing TV commercials lauding its “clean diesel” cars for several years, including ads that ran last November, even as the company was aware of the emissions controversy. VW on Monday said there was no intention to misinform the public with its clean diesel ads.In December, VW issued a voluntary recall of all its U.S. diesel cars from model years 2009-2014.The recall didn’t end the matter. CARB, in cooperation with EPA, said it wanted to do “confirmatory” tests, and it ran those beginning in May 2015. In July, CARB notified VW that the test vehicles still showed emissions that exceeded state and federal limits. California shared those results with federal regulators.VW attributed the excess emissions to “various technical issues” and “unexpected” real-world conditions.It wasn’t until EPA and CARB threatened to withhold certification for the automaker’s 2016 diesel models that VW in early September revised its explanation.“Only then did VW admit it had designed and installed a defeat device in these vehicles in the form of a sophisticated software algorithm that detected when a vehicle was undergoing emissions testing,” the EPA said in its September 18 letter to VW.The EPA on Friday said that it “intends to compel VW to issue a recall” once the automaker has developed a satisfactory fix. But as of mid-day Monday, company and EPA officials said there was no recall.VW executives were scheduled to unveil the 2016 Passat - including a “clean diesel” version - in New York City on Monday evening. The company late Monday said the 2016 Passat diesel has not yet been certified for the U.S. by the EPA.Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit and Tim Gardner in Washington.

              "      <td>- The confession of cheating that’s embroiled Volkswagen AG in one of the biggest scandals in auto industry history came on a cool California morning, on the sidelines of an academic conference focused on green transportation.After more than a year of stonewalling investigators, Volkswagen stunned two senior officials with the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency and California’s environmental watchdog by admitting the automaker hacked its own cars to deceive U.S. regulators about how much their diesel engines pollute.That disclosure on Aug. 21, confirmed by two people with knowledge of the exchange, shows Volkswagen buckled to pressure from environmental regulators almost a month earlier than the scandal was made public. The admission to regulators came after a year during which VW officials insisted to regulators that tests on its diesel cars showing a spike in pollution levels on the road were in error.U.S. officials exposed the deception on Sept. 18, triggering Volkswagen’s admission that it had installed software in its cars to detect when they were being tested and alter settings to conceal the true emissions of 11 million cars sold worldwide. The delay between VW’s confession and the U.S. exposure of the scandal occurred as regulators prepared their response to the disclosure.As a result, Volkswagen, the world’s largest automaker by sales, faces EPA fines that could reach $18 billion, class action and other lawsuits that could add billions of dollars more in liability and a U.S. criminal investigation. VW’s leadership is in turmoil after chairman Martin Winterkorn was forced to resign and sources said other executives including the head of U.S operations were soon to follow.Now, the story of how investigators unraveled systemic cheating in the face of consistent denials from the company may have implications for the sanctions VW will face and for an auto industry certain to face more scrutiny about its environmental claims. The company’s lack of cooperation could figure into punitive action by the government.At first, regulators were surprised that Volkswagen would make its confession at the conference, held in Pacific Grove, California. Minutes before Christopher Grundler, director of the EPA’s transportation and air quality office, was to deliver a 9 a.m. speech to the conference, a Volkswagen representative told him about the deception. At the same meeting, representatives of the California Air Resources Board, a state agency that had been pushing VW hard, were also given a verbal notice of the deception, people with knowledge of the events said.Volkswagen declined to comment on the sequence of events described to Reuters. It isn’t clear who the VW representative was who delivered the news of the deception to Grundler and the CARB. Stuart Johnson, head of VW’s engineering and environmental office in the United States, was registered to attend the Aug. 21 conference, which was organized by the University of California, Davis. Johnson, who still works for VW in Auburn Hills, Michigan, did not respond immediately to a request for comment.Norbert Krause, who was head of VW’s U.S. environmental office until 2009 and who retired from VW in 2011, said nobody at Volkswagen of America was involved in the process of engineering the diesel cars.“I don’t know anything about the modification of the software,” Krause said when reached by telephone in Germany. “The software was okay when we certified the vehicle and we made our durability runs. Everything was fine.”DECEPTION ACKNOWLEDGEDA formal acknowledgement of the deception came on Sept. 3, when the EPA and California officials held a conference call with Volkswagen executives in Germany and the U.S. During the call, the automaker went over written details provided to the participants explaining how software used in its diesel cars was able to manipulate emissions tests in the United States.That admission came after the EPA threatened to withhold approval for the company’s 2016 Volkswagen and Audi diesel models, according to a letter sent by the EPA to Johnson and VW’s attorney. The letter detailed some of the timetable of the EPA’s actions.So ended 15 months of back-and-forth between Volkswagen and U.S. and California regulators who had come to suspect that the diesel engines were producing higher nitrogen oxide emissions during normal driving conditions than what was certified by the EPA and California, people involved said. Nitrogen oxide emissions have been linked to smog and acid rain.Volkswagen had heavily marketed what it called “clean diesel” engines starting in 2008 with the 2009-model Jetta TDI. It appeared to have found a sweet spot between high-performance and fuel-efficiency with a zippy, fun-to-drive car that topped 40 miles per gallon in highway driving. Named “Green Car of the Year” at the Los Angeles auto show in 2008, the Jetta TDI was seen as a breakthrough in a country where diesel passenger cars occupy a tiny niche compared with Europe, where they are about half of the market.GRANDFATHER’S DIESEL“It’s not your grandfather’s diesel,” Krause said in a September 2008 presentation to U.S. regulators, according to a video of the remarks.Krause and other VW officials promised a diesel that would meet pollution laws in all states, including California where diesel engines had long been associated with smog and cancer-causing soot.By that point, VW and other automakers had lobbied for almost a decade for regulators to give diesel another chance. In 2000, VW and other companies with an interest in promoting diesel, including Mazda, formed the Diesel Technology Forum to lobby for increased use in the United States as a way to reduce reliance on imported oil. In 2005, an energy bill signed by President George W. Bush offered tax credits for diesel buyers. That gave the first wave of diesel Jetta buyers an income tax credit of $1,300 each.In 2009, after the new Jetta went on sale, VW dealers initially sold out, including in California where regulations had effectively shut the market to diesels earlier in the decade.Around the same time, in Europe, regulators were skeptical. A European Commission study concluded in 2013 that European car makers were exploiting test loopholes. Separate findings by the EC’s Joint Research Centre showed a discrepancy between test results and real world performance in European diesel engines.California began its inquiry after EC regulators sought to obtain American data on the on-road emissions performance of diesel engines, said Stanley Young, CARB’s communications director. The Europeans had a working theory that diesels should run more cleanly in the United States, where regulations are stricter, than in Europe.To produce that data, they commissioned the U.S.-based nonprofit International Council on Clean Transportation in February 2013, which hired researchers at a West Virginia University lab.The WVU researchers placed emission-monitoring equipment on a rented 2012 Jetta and a 2013 Passat. Over seven weeks in spring 2013, they drove the cars around Los Angeles and up the West Coast to Seattle, comparing them to a BMW X5 sport-utility with a diesel engine, said Daniel Carder, who led the WVU team. While the BMW’s emission results came in under what the vehicles produced in laboratory tests, those of the Jetta were 15 to 35 times higher than the legal limit and the Passat 10 to 20 times higher.Soon after, the same rental cars tested by WVU were monitored in CARB’s El Monte, California, test facility east of Los Angeles. There were no irregular emissions.Over the next 12 months, the West Virginia University researchers analyzed the data. They presented their findings at a March 31, 2014, conference in San Diego partly sponsored by California regulators and the EPA.EXECUTIVES ON ALERT“That data put our executives on alert that there was clearly a problem for the U.S. and California,” said Young, the CARB official.At meetings between California officials and Volkswagen that began in the summer of 2014, engineers from the German carmaker tried to “discredit the findings” by challenging the data and methodology of the study, Young said. “They were recalcitrant,” he said. “It was a range of issues. Every time it was something different.”Among other things, VW said that “our calibration was off” and that the discrepancies had to do with “the conditions under which the test was done,” Young said.On Dec. 2, Volkswagen shared the results of its own tests, blaming its increased emissions on “various technical issues and unexpected in-use conditions,” according to the EPA. Then Volkswagen agreed to recall vehicles to fix their engine-control software.Engineers at CARB kept testing and found the proposed software fix did not significantly reduce emissions. A break came when they looked at diagnostic data stored in the cars’ own computer system.“We discovered some very strange anomalies,” Young said. “For instance, the car was running more cleanly when it was cold than when it was warm, which is the opposite of what every other car does - because once you warm a car up that’s when it begins to deliver its best pollution controls. This was not the case. So clearly something else was going on. Over time we assembled enough proof and questions that they could no longer provide any reasonable explanation for what was going on.”On July 8, CARB shared its results with VW, but there was no change in Volkswagen’s position. Some officials privately questioned whether Volkswagen was deliberately violating the federal Clean Air Act by installing defeat devices -- software programmed to switch engines to a cleaner mode during official emissions testing, according to a person involved in the process.During normal driving, the software then shuts off, enabling cars to emit as much as 40 times the legal limit of pollutants.In early August, Oliver Schmidt, who followed Krause and preceded Johnson in VW’s U.S. engineering and environmental office, attended a conference in Traverse City, Michigan and told regulators Volkswagen stood by its conclusions that the problem was technical, said people involved said. Schmidt declined to speak to Reuters.“I’m just amazed,” said Alan Lloyd, who headed CARB from 1999 to 2004 and helped open California’s market to diesels. “Why someone would think they could cheat in this way and get away with it is beyond me.”Additional reporting by Bruce Wallace, Patric Rucker, Alexandria Sage, Ayesha Rascoe, Kevin Krolicki and Idrees Ali; writing by Jason Szep.

              "      <td>- Volkswagen AG ‘s promise to fix pollution control systems on about 11 million diesel vehicles will involve changes to software, and possibly hardware, that could leave owners with cars that deliver diminished fuel economy and performance or require more maintenance, experts said Tuesday.The German automaker’s new chief executive, Matthias Mueller, said Tuesday VW customers would need to have those diesel cars “refitted.” The company did not specify what the refitting might entail. Some analysts have said the job could cost more than $6.5 billion.A former executive of Volkswagen’s U.S. operation said Tuesday the company may be required to change only software, and not hardware, to bring older diesel models now deemed illegal into compliance with U.S. emissions standards.Other experts and U.S. regulators said the German automaker likely will have to come up with two sets of solutions for two different emission-control systems installed on 482,000 U.S. diesel cars from model years 2009-2015.VW has admitted using software that circumvented U.S. and California pollution rules by fully activating the exhaust scrubbing systems only when the car was being put through precisely prescribed government emissions tests.VW hasn’t said why it used the illegal “defeat device” to deceive regulators. But the results, at least in the short term, were beneficial: VW was able to pass laboratory tests that showed its U.S. diesel cars met the relevant regulations, but then switched off the emission control devices while driving.The benefits of switching the pollution control systems off were different depending on which system the vehicles used, experts said.VW initially installed the illegal software, beginning in late 2008, on 2.0-liter four-cylinder turbo-diesel engines fitted with devices known as “lean NOx traps,” designed to reduce nitrogen oxides in engine exhaust. Nitrogen oxide emissions have been linked to smog, acid rain and lung cancer.EPA on September 25 said it would take longer to fix older VW diesels from model years 2009-2014 that used the lean NOx traps.Any device used to control nitrogen oxide emissions typically “diminishes the performance and fuel economy” of diesel engines, according to automotive consultant Sandy Munro.Older VW diesels could be made to function properly with a software fix, said Marc Trahan, who retired in late 2014 as executive vice president of group quality after a 35-year career with VW and its Audi subsidiary. They should not need to have newer hardware installed, which would take much longer, require extensive “re-engineering” and be cost-prohibitive, he said.Beginning in 2012, Volkswagen offered the same 2.0 TDI engines with a more sophisticated and expensive emissions control system called Selective Catalytic Reduction. These systems, which debuted on VW’s largest car, the Passat, injected a liquid urea solution into the exhaust to break down the nitrogen oxides.These systems also had software that turned them off during normal driving, the company has admitted. The consequences of running the systems all the time will be different for consumers than the older, NOx traps.Ideally, the urea solution used to control smog-forming gases is supposed to be replaced every 10,000 miles, typically by a dealer, but VW encountered potential problems.On newer models with the SCR system, Trahan said there were concerns within the company about the urea consumption being so great that it would require separate “fill-ups” every 5,000 miles, rather than the desired 10,000-mile intervals that are typical between engine oil changes.A software update on the newer diesel models equipped with SCR devices could lead to “reduced vehicle performance and fuel economy and increased urea use,” said analyst Kevin Riddell of LMC Automotive. The new software “also will have an impact on resale value and potential marketability,” he said. (Additional reporting by Joseph White in Detroit.

              "      <td>- As Volkswagen AG prepares to explain how it might fix the polluting diesel cars that set off the biggest scandal in the German automaker’s history, whatever solution it proposes could be undermined by some owners in the United States who won’t bring their cars in for a recall and can’t be forced to.A logo of Volkswagen is seen at a dealership in Seoul, South Korea, October 5, 2015.  REUTERS/Kim Hong-JiThe cars, some 482,000 Passats, Golfs and Jettas sold in model years 2009 to 2015 in the United States, are peppy and fun to drive, owners say. Because fixing the cars is likely to result in lower performance and fuel economy, some drivers will decline, even though their cars would continue to spew 40 times the smog-producing emissions permitted by some states. If they do, there are few enforcement levers in place.In the three states with the most VW diesel cars caught up in the emissions scandal, only California withholds registration renewals from cars that fail to comply with recalls. In Texas and Florida, which have the second- and third-highest number of VW diesels after California, there are no emission standards in place for diesel vehicles.Nationally, only 17 states are required by the Clean Air Act to confirm that owners of cars subjected to a recall show proof they have complied with it before they are allowed to take an emissions test required to register their cars, the Environmental Protection Agency said.The EPA couldn’t confirm whether the 33 other states don’t require owners to prove they have complied with a recalI. Texas doesn’t include diesel vehicles in its emission inspection program and Florida no longer has a vehicle emission inspection program, EPA said. It isn’t known how many other states don’t require vehicles to pass emissions tests.The EPA has said a recall is likely.“I love the car,” said the owner of a diesel Passat in Florida named Thomas, who didn’t want to give his last name because of privacy concerns. “However, a lot of that is based upon the performance of the car. I am very dismayed that I am now in the position of ignoring the recall to have the performance of the car versus having the recall performed and the car not performing like the one I purchased.”Jared Allen, a spokesman with the National Auto Dealers Association, said loopholes in states such as Florida are why the nationwide recall completion rate hovers around 70 percent.“There is no enforcement mechanism that is tied to the consumer’s ability to continue driving the vehicle,” Allen said.German regulators have set a Wednesday deadline for VW to disclose how vehicles will be fixed to comply with EU emissions laws.. On Thursday, VW’s U.S. head will testify before U.S. lawmakers.In the meantime, one owner on the VWVortex website said that VW would have to wave “a big carrot” in front of their customers to get them to comply with the recall.That could come in the form of loyalty programs, trade-ins, or cash incentives. VW late last week informed dealers it would offer “loyalty bonuses” of $2,000 for owners who want to trade in their cars.Thomas from Florida said he doubted that would be enough: “I think the hit we’ll take in resale will be much greater than that.”The EPA has the authority to order VW to recall the vehicles, but its authority to compel consumers to get their cars repaired is limited.Asked about enforcement levers, the EPA said a recall wouldn’t necessarily require owners to repair their vehicle. Manufacturers have to submit quarterly reports summarizing response rates to the agency, the EPA said.But the stakes of disobeying a recall are clear: “Without the repairs, vehicles may be emitting harmful pollutants in excess of the federal emission standards,” the EPA said in a statement to Reuters.In a recall, California officials deny re-registrations to owners who fail to bring their vehicles into compliance. Vehicles are registered yearly so owners could get away without a fix for up to a year without being caught.“I’d most likely wait as long as possible and let others be the technology pathfinders and get my cars ‘fixed’ only when there was a hard deadline by California after other folks get all the bugs worked out,” said owner David Rosing of Los Angeles.A majority of states, however, including Texas and Florida, have no such laws, frustrating environmentalists.“I’m a bit surprised if Texas and Florida don’t do the same thing (as California) and the EPA doesn’t enforce that,” said Roland Hwang, director of the National Resource Defense Council’s energy and transportation program.One thing that could affect the recall response rate is that problem is emissions-related and not a safety issue. Even in safety recalls, many vehicle owners don’t take cars back to dealers to get them repaired, as they are not forced to.According to the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which is currently researching recall response rates, in 99 percent of safety recalls from 2000 to 2013, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not issue an unconditional “do not drive” recommendation.That means that without Volkswagen’s prodding its customers or wooing them with financial incentives, regulators can do little but hope that owners will comply.“Regulators should be giving the orders and calling the shots,” said Kristen Monsell, an attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity. “Instead, VW seems to be in the driver’s seat.”Writing by Alexandria Sage; Editing by Steve Trousdale and John PickeringOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

              "      <td>- Volkswagen will cut investment plans at its biggest division by 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year and step up development of electric vehicles, it said on Tuesday, as it battles to cope with the fallout from its cheating of diesel emissions tests.The German company also said it would speed up cost cutting at the VW division, its largest by revenues, and put only the latest and “best environmental technology” in diesel vehicles.Europe’s largest carmaker is battling the biggest business crisis in its 78-year history after admitting last month it installed software in diesel vehicles to deceive U.S. regulators about the true level of their toxic emissions.The scandal has wiped about a quarter off its market value, forced out its long-time chief executive and rocked both the global car industry and the German economy.Germany’s ZEW think tank said on Tuesday its economic sentiment index had plummeted to its lowest level in a year, in part because of the uncertainty surrounding the auto industry, which employs more than 750,000 people in the country and is a major source of export income.Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said he did not think Volkswagen's VOWG_p.DE problems would do lasting damage to Europe's largest economy, however.Some analysts said a strategy more focused on electric vehicles and hybrids could eventually help sow the seeds of recovery for Volkswagen.“There is a real chance for VW to even extract something positive from the diesel fiasco,” said Stefan Bratzel, head of the Center of Automotive Management think-tank near Cologne.“Funneling more resources into electric mobility gives them a credible future perspective to try to overcome this crisis.”But the company has a mountain to climb.Volkswagen sources told Reuters on Friday its namesake division would probably slump to a loss this year because it was set to shoulder the bulk of costs related to the scandal.Related CoverageEPA hasn't decided if new software on 2016 VW diesels is legalVW crisis, emerging markets hit German investor moraleThe company has said it may have to refit up to 11 million diesel vehicles that could contain cheat software, with around 5 million of those from the VW brand.Some analysts have said the group could ultimately face a bill of as much as 35 billion euros for refitting vehicles, regulatory fines, lawsuits and other costs.At 1310 GMT, Volkswagen shares were down 3.5 percent at 104.75 euros.SAVING MONEYVolkswagen will cut spending on models, technology and production facilities at the VW brand by 1 billion euros a year through 2019 from its previous plans, a spokesman said.He declined to say what those investment plans had been.Last November, Volkswagen announced 85.6 billion euros of investments across the group between 2015 and 2019, with half earmarked for modernizing and expanding the model range.Other brands within the group, which includes Audi, Porsche, Seat and Skoda, are reviewing spending commitments, the spokesman said, without giving details.Volkswagen said last year it planned to increase cost savings at the VW division, where profit margins lag much of the rest of the group as well as major rival Toyota, to 5 billion euros a year by 2017.On Tuesday, the division said it would speed up those cuts and stop making the money-losing Phaeton luxury saloon, a pet project of former chairman Ferdinand Piech that has never met its original sales target of 20,000 cars a year.A Volkswagen logo is seen on one of the German automaker's cars in a street in Sydney, Australia, October 8, 2015. REUTERS/David Gray The next-generation Phaeton, due to hit showrooms by about 2019-2020, will only be offered as an electric vehicle, it said.ELECTRIC CARSAnalysts have warned Volkswagen’s problems could cast a shadow over the entire diesel vehicle industry.Although other carmakers do not appear to have used so-called defeat device software to cheat emissions tests, the scandal has highlighted differences between laboratory results and the on-road emissions of cars and vans often marketed to buyers as cleaner alternatives to using gasoline.Tighter rules are being introduced that could hit the competitiveness of diesel vehicles. That would be a particular blow for manufacturers in Europe, where around a half of new car sales are diesels versus a small fraction in the United States.Volkswagen said on Tuesday it would expand its so-called MQB modular platform -- the base for virtually all of the group’s small and medium front-wheel-drive family models -- to focus more strongly on long-range plug-in hybrids and electric vehicles with a range of up to 300 km (186 miles).The MQB platform uses a large number of common parts across its range of models and brands, allowing it to assemble vehicles more quickly and at lower costs.The company has said it wants to increase MQB-based vehicle output to 7 million cars by 2018 from about 2 million last year. Volkswagen sold 10.1 million vehicles in total last year.While MQB is capable of hosting all types of powertrains including diesel, gasoline and fully-electric vehicles, Volkswagen said on Tuesday it would also develop a new modular platform dubbed MEB for compact electric passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.The standardized system will serve as the basis for models with an all-electric range of 250-500 km, it said.At the Frankfurt auto show last month, Volkswagen said it would launch 20 battery-powered and plug-in hybrid vehicles by the end of the decade, including the first all-electric Porsche “Mission E” and Audi’s e-tron Quattro concept unveiled at the show.Even after Tuesday’s cuts, Volkswagen’s investment spending dwarfs that of most major rivals, making it potentially better placed to bounce back from any hit to the diesel market.Exane analysts estimate Volkswagen will spend 11.9 billion euros on development this year, 65 percent more than Fiat, Renault and Peugeot combined.($1 = 0.8795 euros)Writing by Mark Potter; Editing by Anna Willard and Susan ThomasOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

Should there be a change in sales volumes, we would react rapidly.”Lower Saxony Premier Stefan Weil, a VW supervisory board member, said sales had been stable in October so far.Volkswagen also confirmed it had stopped the sale within the European Union of new cars containing the software that can cheat diesel emissions tests.VW admitted on Sept. 18 it used illegal software to manipulate emissions tests on diesel vehicles in the United States, sparking the biggest business crisis in its history.The admission has wiped about a quarter off its stock market value, forced out its long-time chief executive and sparked investigations and lawsuits across the world.Volkswagen has suspended Frank Tuch, head of group quality control, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.Tuch is the fifth suspended worker whose name has become public. Volkswagen declined to comment and Tuch did not reply to repeated attempts by Reuters to contact him.Asked whether a small group of employees could have alone been responsible for the deception, Mueller said: “We are still deep in the middle of the clarification, including the question of the possible culprits and causes.”Mueller, who replaced former chief executive Martin Winterkorn a week after the scandal broke, said the investigations were “relatively extensive and complicated” and went back to 2005.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

The company will begin notifying affected owners in the first quarter of 2016, when the software fix is ready.The Brazilian recall is small compared to an estimated 11 million vehicles worldwide that may contain the banned software allowing them to temporarily reduce toxic emissions during tests, according to Volkswagen.Brazil’s environmental agency, Ibama, said last month it was investigating whether Volkswagen had violated domestic emissions laws, which could bring a fine of up to 50 million reais ($13 million).The Amarok is Volkswagen’s only diesel option in Brazil’s passenger-vehicle market.

Retail price discounts range up to $7,850 on the 2015 Passat, according to an online survey of VW dealers on Wednesday. Discounts of up to $7,290 are being offered on the 2015 Jetta and up to $5,625 on the 2016 Jetta. Battery electric models such as the e-Golf have discounts of up to $11,000, while gasoline-electric models such as the Jetta Hybrid have prices slashed by up to $6,000.Meanwhile, a potential deal between VW and U.S. and California regulators to fix nearly 500,000 diesel cars with illegal software could still be weeks away, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.The German automaker continues to work to get its 2016 diesel models approved for sale by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, one of the sources said.VW on Tuesday said it was “continuing to work with the agencies to provide a remedy” to resolve its diesel issues, but that it had “no announcements on timing.” CARB has given VW a Nov. 20 deadline to present solutions. EPA has not specified a deadline, but is working closely with CARB.Related CoverageVolkswagen's U.S. dealers prime the pumpOwners of diesel VW models are “sitting back and waiting to see how much they’ll be compensated” in the form of discounts and other incentives, said Dennis Gaudet, a New Hampshire dealer who attended VW’s annual U.S. dealer meeting last week in Orlando.VW has given U.S. dealers some money “to be able to take care of the customers who might be having the most difficult time,” said Gaudet.After the scandal broke in mid-September, VW ordered its U.S. dealers to stop sales of 2015 models with four-cylinder diesel engines. The 2016 diesels have not been certified for sale by the EPA.Previously, TDI versions of the Passat, Jetta, Golf and Beetle accounted for 20 percent or more of VW’s U.S. sales.The one TDI model left on most VW dealer lots - the big Touareg V6 crossover - now comes with some of the heaviest price cuts, with a Houston dealer offering $11,400 off the sticker price of 2016 models and nearly $15,000 off 2015 models.Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit and Alexandria Sage in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Rory Carroll in San Francisco; Editing by Chris ReeseOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

              "      <td>- Germany is to retest all Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE car models to gauge their genuine emissions levels after new revelations from the carmaker six weeks into its biggest-ever corporate scandal pushed the government to act.Expressing his “irritation” with one of Germany’s biggest employers, Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt said on Wednesday that all current models sold under the VW, Audi, Skoda and Seat brands - with both diesel and petrol engines - would be tested for carbon dioxide and nitrogen dioxide emissions.As the crisis deepened, VW said it had told U.S. and Canadian dealers to stop selling recent models equipped with its 3.0 V6 TDI diesel engine, while the Moody’s agency downgraded the firm’s credit rating.The German government’s announcement followed a VW statement on Tuesday that it had understated the level of carbon dioxide emissions in around 800,000 cars sold mainly in Europe, and consequently their fuel usage. This means affected vehicles are more expensive to drive than their buyers had been led to believe.The revelations added a new dimension to a crisis that had previously focused on how Europe’s biggest carmaker cheated in U.S. tests on diesel cars for emissions of nitrogen oxide, which cause smog.Previously the government had said it would review only nitrogen dioxide emissions from VW diesel cars.“We all have an interest that everything at VW is turned over and reviewed,” Dobrindt said, adding that the government wanted to force the company to pay the extra car taxes which would be incurred by the higher CO2 emissions levels.VW is Europe’s biggest motor manufacturer, employing over 750,000 people in Germany, and has been a symbol of the nation’s engineering prowess.However, Dobrindt said the firm had caused “irritation in my ministry and with me”, while Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokesman said it had to take steps to prevent such a case happening again, adding: “VW has a duty to clear this up transparently and comprehensively.”Related CoverageVolkswagen to recall some gas-powered vehicles in U.S., CanadaThe admission about fuel consumption is the first that threatens to make a serious dent in VW’s sales since the scandal erupted as it could deter cost-conscious consumers, analysts said.Tuesday’s revelations, which led to Volkswagen adding 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) to its expected costs from the scandal, are also the first time gasoline cars have been drawn into the crisis.VW said most of the 800,000 cars affected had diesel engines such as VW’s top-selling Golf, Audi’s A3 hatchback and the Skoda Octavia but two models were gasoline: the VW Polo and the Audi A1, both with 1.4 litre engines.Moody’s said it had downgraded Volkswagen’s credit rating to A3/P-2 with a negative outlook due to this revelation.“These new claims pose further challenges to Volkswagen’s financial flexibility and competitive position, and heighten Moody’s concerns about Volkswagen’s internal control and governance issues, thus further weakening its rating profile,” said Yasmina Serghini, Moody’s lead analyst for VW.Shares in Volkswagen closed down 9.5 percent, wiping more than another 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) off its market value. It has lost almost a third of its value or 24 billion euros since the scandal broke.VW’s “stop-sale” order in the United States and Canada followed a notice by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that VW group brands had installed illegal devices on some 3.0 V6 diesel models.“BEYOND A JOKE”Logos of VW are pictured at a car shop in Bad Honnef near Bonn, Germany, November 4, 2015. REUTERS/Wolfgang RattayErnst-Robert Nouvertne, who runs two Volkswagen dealerships near Cologne with VW, Audi and Skoda models, said the situation was getting “beyond a joke”.“As bad as it is, the emissions issue alone would be manageable but this (CO2 admissions) is adding a new dimension to our troubles. I hope we will get through this at some point.“People have already started to rail against VW. If they start railing about our product we have a problem.”The scandal erupted on Sept. 18 when U.S. authorities exposed VW’s use of “defeat devices” to cheat tests for emissions of nitrogen oxide. VW admitted such software was installed in up to 11 million diesel vehicles worldwide.VW’s latest admission came after U.S. environmental regulators said the carmaker had failed to inform them that similar devices were installed on the larger 3.0 litre engines used in luxury sport utility vehicles from Porsche and Audi.VW has denied that but Mary Nichols, chair of the California Air Resources Board in Los Angeles, told Reuters that regulators repeatedly saw the engines cycle through tests with a relatively low amount of emissions, only to see an increase in pollution a couple of seconds later.“It’s almost impossible to explain something like that in any way other than something about the software that controls the operation,” Nichols said, noting that Volkswagen had tried to argue that the phenomenon was part of an effort to “warm up the system.”“In all honesty that explanation doesn’t make any sense,” she said.German lawyer Andreas Tilp, who filed legal action against VW last month on behalf of a private investor in the firm, said the CO2 admission gave the case “extra ammunition”.“With every widening of the scandal, the likelihood grows that a large number of people at VW had knowledge,” he said.Volkswagen’s U.S. boss has said the rigging of emissions tests was the result of actions by a small number of engineers.“Another week, another shock in the VW story,” Exane BNP Paribas analyst Stuart Pearson wrote in a note. “We add another 4 billion euros in recall costs and fear a harsher commercial impact,” said Pearson, who rates VW “neutral”.The effects of the scandal have so far barely been reflected in VW sales figures - although it was the only German carmaker to report a decline in car registrations in Germany in October.($1 = 0.9208 euros)Additional reporting by Georgina Prodhan, Jan Schwartz, Joern Poltz, Irene Preisinger, Gernot Heller and Paul Lienert; Writing by Pravin Char and Christian PlumbOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",
