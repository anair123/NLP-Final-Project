Picture taken on July 4, 2016.  REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji - RTX2K296The South Korean technology firm is looking for ways to sustain earnings momentum after reviving its mobile profits by restructuring its product line-up. As growth in the global smartphone market hits a plateau, Samsung wants to maximize its cost efficiency and keep operating margins above 10 percent.The world’s top smartphone maker will refurbish high-end phones returned to the company by users who signed up for one-year upgrade programs in markets such as South Korea and the United States.Samsung would then re-sell these phones at a lower price, the person said, declining to be identified as the plan was not yet public.The person declined to say how big a discount the refurbished phones would be sold at, which markets the phones would be sold in or how many refurbished devices Samsung could sell.A Samsung spokeswoman said the company does not comment on speculation.It was not clear to what extent the phones would be altered, but refurbished phones typically are fitted with parts such as a new casing or battery.Rival Apple Inc’s iPhone has a re-sale value of around 69 percent of its original price after about one year from launch, while Samsung’s flagship Galaxy sells for 51 percent of the original price in the U.S. market, according to BNP Paribas.Refurbished phones could help vendors such as Samsung boost their presence in emerging markets such as India, where high-end devices costing $800 or so are beyond most buyers.Apple sells refurbished iPhones in a number of markets including the United States, but does not disclose sales figures. It is trying to sell such iPhones in India, where the average smartphone sells for less than $90.Selling used phones could help Samsung fend off lower-cost Chinese rivals that have been eating into its market share, and free up some capital to invest elsewhere or boost marketing expenditure.Deloitte says the used smartphone market will be worth more than $17 billion this year, with 120 million devices sold or traded in to manufacturers or carriers - around 8 percent of total smartphone sales. Some market experts expect the used market to grow fast as there are fewer technology breakthroughs.“Some consumers may prefer to buy refurbished, used premium models in lieu of new budget brands, possibly cannibalizing sales of new devices from those budget manufacturers,” Deloitte said in a report.CANNIBALIZATION RISKSamsung’s refurbishment program, details of which the person said could be finalised as early as 2017, could help the firm generate revenue from dated high-end smartphones returned by users upgrading to newer versions.The company’s latest premium phones, the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy Note 7, have received favorable reviews, suggesting cheaper, refurbished versions could be popular. At U.S. carrier Verizon Communications, the Galaxy S7 edge with 32-gigabyte storage retails for $792 without subsidies, while the Note 7 costs $864.The program could help Samsung defend market share in emerging countries by bolstering mid-tier sales. Refurbished phones could also appeal to enterprise clients who want certain security or software products pre-installed on phones to give to their employees, the source said.The risk of offering refurbished devices is that they could potentially cannibalize sales of Samsung’s other mid-tier devices.Expectations for solid smartphone sales helped Samsung shares to a record 1.675 million won each on Friday, taking two-day gains to 7 percent and adding $15 billion in market value. The shares traded down 0.36 percent in Seoul on Monday.Reporting by Se Young Lee and Miyoung Kim; Editing by Tony Munroe and Ian GeogheganOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

Samsung and Tencent have been more volatile than the Asia tech sector .MIAS0IT00PUS and the broader market .MIAS00000PUS this year.On Wednesday, Samsung said sales of its latest flagship smartphone were out-stripping supply, but second-half profits could still take a hit if production shortfalls are not fixed and a recovery in components demand fails to eventuate.Moody’s Investor Service also warned that Samsung’s profit margins might narrow in the second half because of seasonal factors in the consumer electronics business and competitive pressures.For Tencent, the market expectations that are driving shares higher are themselves a risk, according to Nomura. A faster-than-expected slowdown in personal computer game revenue, aggressive spending and new products or business models from competitors could weigh on earnings, the bank warned.People are silhouetted as they pose with mobile devices in front of a screen projected with a Samsung logo, in this picture illustration taken in Zenica October 29, 2014.     REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo - RTSJ41VTHE NUMBERSSamsung and Tencent have added about $30 billion in market value since Thursday, surging to all-time highs. Tencent is valued at $249 billion, only 4 percent smaller than the most valuable Asian firm, China Mobile 0941.HK, at $259 billion. Samsung is now worth $239 billion. Tencent is now the world’s 12th-biggest company by market value and Samsung the 17th-largest, Thomson Reuters data shows. That’s up from Nos. 26 and 33 respectively just five months ago, according to a PricewaterhouseCoopers ranking released March 31.Samsung shares’ have significantly outperformed Apple’s - the Korean firm has leapt 50 percent over the past year, while the U.S. company has gained 3 percent amid concern about weak sales in China.The gap between Samsung’s price-to-earnings ratio of 12.4 and Apple’s 12.7 is now the narrowest since late 2011, although Samsung is still worth less than half the $586 billion Apple, according to Thomson Reuters data.Samsung’s share price growth spurt comes after years of struggle in its smartphone business which left investors impatient for higher returns.The firm revived mobile profits by restructuring its product line-up this year and is seeking ways to sustain earnings momentum. Buybacks and higher dividends have also boosted shares.Tencent is significantly more expensive than Samsung. The Chinese internet firm, whose popular WeChat and Weixin messaging apps in China saw active monthly user numbers jump 34 percent in the second quarter, trades at 46.8 times earnings, closing in on Facebook's FB.O 59.China’s slowest economic growth in 25 years and some questionable acquisitions have clouded the outlook for Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, but Tencent has managed to thrive thanks in part to its focus on rapidly growing mobile gaming.Tencent outshone peers including Baidu BIDU.O with a forecast-beating 47 percent jump in second-quarter profit, after it diversified into areas such as music, video and advertising.HSBC expects further earnings growth, driven by new income streams such as advertising, premium content, cloud services and finance.Reporting by Nichola Saminather; Additional reporting by Dahee Kim; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Stephen CoatesOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- The head of Nokia’s small, but highly profitable patent licensing division is leaving after two years in the role, the Finnish company said on Wednesday, weeks after he sealed a pace-setting patent deal with Samsung Electronics.Headquarters of Finnish telecommunication network company Nokia are pictured in Espoo, Finland August 4, 2016. Lehtikuva/Irene Stachon/via REUTERSRamzi Haidamus, 52, is stepping down as president of the Nokia Technologies unit that handles patents and development of new consumer products. The unit also recently struck a licensing deal with HMD Global it hopes will herald the return of the Nokia name into handsets.“Given (the unit’s) progress, now is the right time for me to explore new opportunities to pursue my passion for building and transforming businesses,” Haidamus said in a statement.Haidamus spent a dozen years running patent licensing for Dolby Laboratories before joining Nokia, and will leave at the end of next month, Nokia said. He had remained based in Silicon Valley even after joining the Finnish company in 2014.His departure comes little over a month after Nokia announced the second of two patent licensing agreements with Samsung, the world’s top mobile handset maker, and which takes effect this quarter. It is set to boost Nokia’s patent and brand royalties to an annualized run-rate of around 950 million euros compared to the company’s previous estimate of 800 million euros.The second deal, which covers Nokia-owned patents for use by Samsung in its future products, restored investor confidence after an initial patent pact earlier this year was considered unfavorable to Nokia and poorly received.The Samsung agreements were the first since Nokia sold its handset business to Microsoft in 2014 and potentially set the terms for future patent licensing deals with other major tech firms such as Apple, Huawei [HWT.UL] and Qualcomm, which aren’t due to be renegotiated for several years, financial analysts said.Nokia Technologies, whose principal asset is its broad catalog of patents built up in the days when the company dominated the mobile handset business, contributed less than 2 percent of group revenue in the latest quarter, but 14 percent of profits. It had sales of 391 million euros in the first half of 2016.The unit is also in charge of Nokia’s bid to bring the brand’s mobile phones back to the market and move into other areas of consumer technology, but this push remains in its early days.“I am confident that with its strong foundation, Nokia Technologies will continue its progress without missing a beat,” said chief executive Rajeev Suri. There will be no change in the unit’s strategy.Nokia said it has begun the search for a successor and that Brad Rodrigues, hired earlier this year to head strategy and business development at Nokia Technologies, will assume the role of acting president.Reporting by Tuomas Forsell and Eric Auchard; Editing by Jussi Rosendahl and Alexandra HudsonOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- Samsung Electronics Co Ltd has recalled all Galaxy Note 7 smartphones equipped with batteries it has found to be fire-prone and halted their sales in 10 markets, denting a revival of the firm’s mobile business.Koh Dong-jin, head of the South Korean company’s smartphone business, declined to comment on how many phones needed to be replaced, but said Samsung had sold 2.5 million of the premium devices so far.Speaking at a news conference on Friday, Koh expressed regret over the recall, which will affect markets including South Korea and the United States. Models in China feature a different battery and are not being recalled by Samsung, the world’s biggest smartphone vendor.The recall comes just over two weeks after the company launched its latest premium phone, which features an outsized screen and high-resolution camera. It follows reports of the 988,900 won ($885) phone igniting while charging.The manufacturer plans to replace not only phones with faulty batteries sold to consumers, but also retailer inventories and units in transit. Nomura estimated that more than 1 million units have been sold to end consumers.“I can’t comment on exactly how much the cost will be, but it pains my heart that it will be such a big number,” Koh said.Strategy Analytics said the combined cost of the recall and lost sales would lop $5 billion off Samsung’s smartphone revenue this year and cut smartphone profit margin by 1.5 percent.The scale of the recall is unprecedented for Samsung, which prides itself on its manufacturing prowess. While recalls in the smartphone industry do happen, including for rival Apple Inc, the nature of the problem for the Galaxy Note 7 is a serious blow to Samsung’s reputation, analysts said.The company should act quickly to minimize damage to its smartphone recovery, after a string of product successes had reversed a fall in market share, they added.Slideshow ( 8 images )CUSTOMERS PUT ON HOLDThe phone first launched in 10 markets in North America, Asia and the Middle East. Further roll-outs have occurred since in markets like China, where sales started just this week. Its wider availability, set for coming weeks, is now on hold.While there are occasional reports of phones catching fire or otherwise burning users, documented cases that lead to widespread product recalls remain relatively rare. Samsung said it was aware of 35 reports of affected Note 7 batteries.In 2007, the largest battery recall in consumer electronics history took place when Nokia, then the world’s top mobile handset maker, offered to replace 46 million phone batteries produced for it by Japanese maker Matsushita Battery.Germany’s biggest operator, Deutsche Telekom, said it had stopped delivering orders for the Galaxy Note 7, while French operator Orange said on its website that it had stopped pre-sales of the phone and postponed its planned sales launch - scheduled for Friday.In Britain, mobile carriers EE and Vodafone continue to accept pre-orders for the Note 7 on their sites. A Vodafone spokesman said its planned Sept. 19 sales launch could now slip, but the company was waiting for more details from Samsung to decide.U.S. operators have been taking pre-orders since early August. All major wireless carriers, including No. 1 U.S. wireless provider Verizon Communications Inc, said they had stopped selling the Galaxy Note 7. Samsung said in a separate statement it started an exchange program in the country for the Note 7.Major U.S. retailers Best Buy and Target also said they had halted sales of the Note 7.Slideshow ( 8 images )Verizon said that if a customer wants to return or exchange the Galaxy Note 7, it would waive through Sept. 30 the restocking fee it charges customers. T-Mobile US, majority owned by Deutsche Telekom, said in a statement it would also waive restocking and shipping charges to customers who want to return the recalled phone.SECOND-HALF HOPESSamsung has said it aimed for the Note 7 to maintain strong sales momentum in the second half of the year against stiffening competition from the likes of Apple, which is widely expected to release its latest iPhone next week.Strategy Analytics said Samsung will likely sell fewer than 10 million Note 7s this year compared with its previous estimate of 14 million globally.Samsung said new sales of the Note 7 in affected markets would resume after it deals with replacements, a process it expects will begin in about two weeks. The firm would extend refund periods for affected customers and offer exchanges for other Samsung phones, Koh said.Investors sold Samsung shares after the delay announcement on Thursday, stripping about $7 billion from the firm’s market value, which remains just off recent record highs. Sentiment recovered somewhat in trading on Friday as the shares rose 0.6 percent compared with 0.3 percent in the broader market.Credit Suisse said a recall or major shipment delays could wipe 1.5 trillion won ($1.34 billion) from Samsung’s 2016 operating profit estimate of 30.2 trillion won in an “absolute worst case” scenario.But the brokerage said that scenario was unlikely, as it expected Samsung to resolve the problem before the fourth quarter.HI Securities analyst James Song said the replacement costs may be somewhat limited as Samsung could recycle components of the recalled phones.“It is clever for Samsung to replace the affected models, not offering fixes,” he said, adding this would help consumer confidence.Samsung’s mobile division accounted for about 54 percent of the firm’s January-June operating profit of 14.8 trillion won.($1 = 1,117.4300 Korean won)Additional reporting by Hyunjoo Jin in Seoul, Harro ten Wolde in Berlin, Mathieu Rosemain in Paris, Eric Auchard in Frankfurt, Laura Gardner in London, Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru and Malathi Nayak in New York; Editing by Christopher Cushing, Alexander Smith, Mark Potter and Frances KerryOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic Since last year, the South Korean firm, the world’s largest maker of smartphones, has brought forward the launch of its Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series models by roughly a month.For the June quarter, the strategy helped Samsung to its best profit in more than two years, but it is also putting strain on its supply chain and its manufacturing reputation.On Friday, two weeks after launch, Samsung recalled Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in 10 markets including South Korea and the United States after finding its batteries were prone to ignite, and halted sales of the 988,900 won ($891) device in those markets indefinitely.The recall looks set to hamstring a revival in Samsung’s mobile business just as Apple gears up to launch its new iPhones this month.“Samsung might have over-exerted itself trying to pre-empt Apple, since everybody knows the iPhones launch in September,” said Chang Sea-Jin, business professor at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology and author of “Sony vs. Samsung”, a history of the electronics giants.“It’s an unfortunate event; it feels like Samsung rushed a bit, and it’s possible that this led to suppliers also being hurried.”Samsung said in a statement to Reuters it conducts “extensive preparation” for its products and will release them to the market “only after proper completion of the development process”.The firm said on Friday it had identified a problem in the manufacturing process of a battery supplier it didn’t name.“I am working to straighten out our quality control process,” Samsung’s mobile business chief Koh Dong-jin said then.The scale of the unprecedented recall, which some analysts forecast will cost Samsung nearly $5 billion in revenue this year, follows a separate supply-chain management issue that led to disappointing sales of the Galaxy S6 series last year.Samsung executives said production problems for the curved screens and metal casings used in the Galaxy S6 edge led to a supply shortage for the device, leaving the firm unable to capitalize on the critical acclaim the phone received, sapping earnings momentum.GETTING AHEADCounterpoint analyst Jeff Fieldhack said Samsung stole the thunder from local rival LG Electronics' 066570.KS launch of the G5 smartphone this year by starting the sales of the Galaxy S7 smartphones a month earlier and backing them with an aggressive marketing campaign.“I believe they were trying to create a similar effect by beating Apple to market by (about) a month, too,” he said.“Very often, lab times and testing periods are shrunk to expedite approval and time-to-market of key devices. It is possible all charging scenarios were not thoroughly tested.”Samsung SDI, one of two makers of batteries for the Note 7 - the other has not been identified - said it had not received notice from Samsung Electronics regarding its batteries and declined to comment further, including whether its batteries were found to be faulty. The company declined to comment on a local media report that it had production difficulties and struggled to meet orders in time.While there are occasional reports of phones catching fire or burning users, recalls for such problems are rare. The problem is exacerbated by the fact that batteries in the Galaxy Note 7 can not be removed by the user - a design decision to make the phones slimmer and waterproof.A Samsung executive who declined to be named told Reuters before the recall announcement: “Our production engineers and managers are extremely experienced, and if you ask them to find a solution to adopt a design change, they’d promptly bring things under control.“But even that capability is under growing strain, as we try out new materials and everything is on a very tight schedule.”Local brokerage Korea Investment cut its third-quarter operating profit forecast for Samsung by 1.1 trillion won to 7.1 trillion won due to the recall, though it said the event would not derail the broader rebound of its smartphone business.If haste contributed to the problem, it could now help Samsung limit the impact of the recall.Shares in Samsung were up 0.8 percent in mid-day trade on Tuesday, 4.4 percent below record highs reached two weeks ago, as some investors welcomed the swift decision to launch a global recall.($1 = 1,110.4000 won)Reporting by Se Young Lee; Editing by Miyoung Kim and Will WatermanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File PhotoThe incident comes amid a recall of the Note 7 phones across the globe including South Korea and the United States due to faulty batteries causing the devices to catch fire while charging or in normal use. Samsung has said it has sold 2.5 million phones equipped with the suspect batteries.Late on Sunday, Chinese online financial magazine Caixin cited an internet user's report that their Note 7 phone, bought from JD.com Inc JD.O, had caught fire in what appeared to be the first report in China of a fire involving the handset.Samsung said in a statement on its China website its investigation of the phone shows “the damage to this product was caused by external heating”, without elaborating.Battery maker Amperex Technology Limited (ATL) said separately on Monday one of its batteries was in the Note 7 phone in question, but added its joint investigation with Samsung determined the incident was not directly linked to a battery made by the China-based firm.“According to the burn marks on the sample, we surmise that the source of the heating comes from outside the battery, and it’s very likely that there was an external factor causing the heating problem,” the battery maker said in a statement.A person familiar with the matter told Reuters the phone was damaged by an external heat source, possibly an induction oven or a fan heater.

       "      <td>- Chinese state broadcaster CCTV has slammed South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics Co 005930.KS for what it said was \"discrimination\" against China consumers in its handling of a global recall of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones to replace batteries.In a commentary piece posted on its website on Thursday evening, CCTV said Samsung’s behavior in China after the Sept. 2 recall of 2.5 million phones was “full of arrogance”.CCTV said a video apology Samsung issued to U.S. consumers, along with various replacement options and compensation, was in stark contrast to its treatment of those in China, where the company issued a brief statement saying most phones didn’t need to be replaced. “Samsung’s discriminatory policy has caused discontent from Chinese consumers,” it said.Samsung China didn’t immediately responded to requests for comment on the CCTV criticism.The CCTV criticism may provide an unwelcome distraction for Samsung as seeks to bolster its position in the world’s largest smartphone market. Once the number 1 mobile phone vendor in China, Samsung dropped out of top 5 in 2015, hit by the strong growth of domestic brands like Huawei, Xiaomi and Oppo.A number of big-name global consumer brands have fallen foul of the influential broadcaster's blasts in recent years, prompting firms from German automaker Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.de to Samsung rival Apple Inc AAPL.O to undertake strenuous efforts to bolster their image.Earlier in September, after a meeting with China’s quality safety watchdog, Samsung China issued a brief statement saying 1,858 Note 7 devices sold in the country as part of a test scheme before the official launch would be recalled.Most Note 7s on sale in China have batteries from a different supplier and are not part of its global recall of 2.5 million phones announced on September 2, Samsung said.But after anecdotal reports of a handful of Note 7s catching fire in the mainland, Samsung China issued a statement on Thursday apologizing to Chinese consumers for a “lack of sufficient explanation” on what it said were safe Note 7 phones in China.Reporting by Sijia Jiang; Editing by Kenneth MaxwellOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- Samsung Electronics has agreed to buy Harman International Industries in an $8 billion deal, marking a major push into the auto electronics market and the biggest overseas acquisition ever by a South Korean company.Slideshow ( 2 images )The transaction highlights Samsung’s efforts to break into the high-barrier automotive industry where it has little track record and also marks a strategic shift for the electronics company, which has previously shunned big acquisitions.“An M&amp;A deal this big is a first for us. But it shows that under Jay Y. Lee, the company is changing and open to new ways to grow,” a source familiar with the deal told Reuters, referring to Samsung Electronics’ vice chairman.The purchase of the Stamford, Connecticut-based maker of connected car and audio systems is part of Samsung’s search for new growth areas as its smartphone business - scarred by the withdrawal of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7 - slows.The greater use of electronics and software in vehicles, and the ability of cars to connect to smartphones and other devices, is offering technology companies with new business opportunities.“We have been studying the automotive market for some time. We conclude that organic growth will not get us where we want to go fast enough,” Young Sohn, President and Chief Strategy Officer of Samsung Electronics, said on a conference call.“Samsung will not get into the business of manufacturing cars,” he said.Samsung, a maker of chips, displays, smartphones and TVs, agreed to acquire Harman for $112.00 per share in cash, a 28 percent premium to the U.S. company’s closing price on Friday.Harman shares rose 25.6 percent to their highest level in more than one year.“Harman was missing, in our opinion, a meaningful presence in displays and cockpit electronics; Samsung has these,” Baird Equity Research said in a report.But investors in Samsung had reservations about the purchase price.“Samsung is using its huge cash pile to pull ahead of rivals in the auto technology market. But it remains to be seen whether Samsung will be able to grow into a company that will be able to compete with the likes of Bosch and Continental,” said fund manager Park Jung-hoon of HDC Asset Management, which owns Samsung Electronics shares.Harman's products, which provide infotainment, telematics, connected safety and security services, are used in more than 30 million vehicles made by automakers such as BMW, Toyota Motor Corp and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, according to its website.Harman earns around two-thirds of its revenue from its automotive-related business, and its automotive order backlog as of end-June stood at $24 billion, more than three times annual sales of $6.9 billion in fiscal 2016.Samsung created an automotive electronics business team a year ago to look for opportunities in this area. This year it invested $450 million in Chinese automaker and rechargeable batteries firm BYD Co Ltd.Separately, Samsung has held talks with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) over a potential sale or partnership for the latter’s Magneti Marelli auto parts maker, sources have said.Reporting by Hyunjoo Jin and Miyoung Kim; Additional reporting by Rishika Sadam in Bengaluru; Editing by Edwina Gibbs, Jacqueline Wong and Jane MerrimanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- South Korean prosecutors raided the offices of Samsung Group on Wednesday, a prosecution official said, after media reports of alleged links with a confidante of President Park Geun-hye who has been indicted in an influence-peddling scandal.Prosecutors also raided South Korea’s largest pension fund, the National Pension Service (NPS), an NPS spokeswoman said. The Yonhap news agency reported that investigators were probing NPS’s decision to approve the $8 billion merger of Samsung C&amp;T Corp and Cheil Industries last year.The raids signaled that prosecutors are expanding their investigation into allegations of influence-peddling in the corruption scandal that has rocked Park’s presidency over the relationship between the government and big businesses.NPS, the world’s third-largest pension fund, has come under scrutiny by the media and civic groups over its approval as a major shareholder of the merger between two affiliates of Samsung Group, South Korea’s largest family-run conglomerate.Its backing was seen as crucial to the success of the merger and some South Korean media reports said its approval came under mysterious circumstances.A Samsung Group spokeswoman confirmed prosecution officials had visited the group’s headquarters but she could not provide further details. The NPS spokeswoman declined to give further details.Prosecutors raided four locations - the NPS headquarters, NPS Investment Management office headquarters, Samsung Group offices and the office of a former NPS investment management official - said a prosecution official who was not authorized to speak to the media and declined to be identified.Park and her confidante, Choi Soon-sil, are under investigation for allegedly improperly pressuring major conglomerates, including the Samsung Group, to raise funds for foundations that backed Park’s policy of promoting the cultural and sports communities.“DRAWBACKS TO BUSINESS”Slideshow ( 3 images )Lee Young-ryeol, the senior prosecutor directing the probe, said on Sunday 53 conglomerates, “fearing direct and indirect drawbacks to business activities such as tax audits”, were “coerced to contribute funds” to the foundations.Park Ju-gun, head of research firm CEO Score, said there was little surprise that prosecutors were now seeking evidence in Samsung Group offices about how the merger may have been influenced by the conglomerate’s contributions to the foundations.The merger of the Samsung affiliates was approved by shareholders in July 2015 and prosecutors said the two foundations involved were set up in the following six months.“This was expected. Due to the circumstances in this case, prosecutors cannot help but be suspicious about the genuine intent behind the donation, such as the timing,” CEO Score’s Park said.President Park, through her lawyer, has pushed back on a request by prosecutors to question her about the case, potentially the first time a sitting South Korean president would be interrogated in a criminal case.Park, who’s five-year term ends in February 2018, has resisted calls to resign but has apologized twice, saying she only sought to benefit the economy and not herself, but acknowledges carelessness in her ties with Choi.However, the growing calls for her to resign and Park’s virtual withdrawal from public activities has left a worrying power vacuum in South Korea.Choi and former presidential aide An Chong-bum were indicted on Sunday and charged with abuse of power, a major blow to the president’s fight for political survival.Slideshow ( 3 images )NPS has defended its decision in the face of criticism that the deal helped the Samsung Group family to cement control of the merged firms at the expense of other shareholders.“The reason we approved the merger was due to taking a comprehensive view of the merger’s synergy effect and potential for stock value increase,” it said in a statement last week.There were “special circumstances” where NPS-owned stakes in both firms were valued at a similar amount, it said. The size of NPS’ combined stakes in both firms was about 2.4 trillion won ($2.05 billion), or 3 percent of NPS’ domestic stock portfolio.However, according to records of the NPS Investment Office committee’s decision to back the merger in July 2015, acquired by an opposition lawmaker and seen by Reuters, the NPS had calculated a merger ratio of 1:0.46 of Cheil Industries shares to Samsung C&amp;T shares, based on its valuations of the two firms.This differed from Samsung Group’s proposed ratio of 1:0.35, which the NPS committee noted was comparatively unfavorable to Samsung C&amp;T shareholders.Additional reporting by Cynthia Kim, Yun Hwan Chae and Ju-min Park; Writing by Jack Kim; Editing by Stephen Coates and Paul TaitOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, under pressure from shareholders to improve investor returns, said on Tuesday it will consider creating a holding company in what would be the biggest shake-up in its 47-year history.The move and a plan to raise dividends come after U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management in October called for the South Korean firm to split itself into a holding vehicle and an operating company.However, the world’s top maker of smartphones, memory chips and televisions, said it was “absolutely neutral” about whether to proceed and provided little detail on the potential restructuring, underwhelming investors.“The review does not indicate the management or the board’s intention one way or another,” the company said in a statement, adding it had hired external advisers for a review expected to take at least six months.Samsung’s statement keeps the door open for Elliott to continue its pressure on the company, which includes the hedge fund’s ability to nominate board directors at the next annual meeting.Elliott, through its holding company affiliates, Blake Capital and Potter Capital, called Samsung’s plan a “constructive initial step.” But the $27 billion hedge fund also signaled it wanted more.“We anticipate more meaningful changes following the company’s corporate structure review,” the Elliott affiliates said in a statement on Tuesday.The shareholder pressure on Samsung comes as the company juggles a leadership succession and a major blow to its brand after issuing an unprecedented recall of at least 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7 smartphones in September.Shares in Samsung, worth $224 billion combined, finished unchanged on the day at 1.677 million won ($1,434) each. The 2016 dividend boost fell short of some expectations, while uncertainty over the restructuring kept investors at bay, analysts said.Related CoverageSamsung Elec surges to record high on payout growth hopes“There is some disappointment that the dividend wasn’t even higher or possibly a special dividend, and this is the reason for a flat share price today,” said Sat Duhra, asset manager at Henderson Global Investors.Samsung did not directly mention Elliott in its statement, but the Korean firm promised to respond to the fund’s ideas by the end of November.Elliott, which launched its Samsung campaign last month, owns 0.62 percent of Samsung’s stock.Samsung pledged to return 50 percent of free cash flow to shareholders for 2016 and 2017, falling short of Elliott’s call for 75 percent to be returned and to pay a $26 billion special dividend.Samsung rejected another Elliott proposal by saying that even if it adopts a holding company, it has no plans at present to merge that with Samsung C&amp;T Corp 028260.KS, the group's current de facto holding company and a firm that Elliott has previously targeted. “I don’t think Samsung said much that was surprising or beyond what investors already had in mind,” said HDC Asset Management fund manager Park Jung-hoon.SUCCESSIONInvestors and analysts have long viewed a split for Samsung Electronics as a way for the Lee family scion, Jay Y. Lee, and his two sisters to boost their control of Samsung Group [SAGR.UL] companies.A Samsung Electronics laptop computer is displayed at a shop in Samsung's main office building in central Seoul July 23, 2013.     REUTERS/Lee Jae-Won/File PhotoThey have said that Samsung shares trade at steep discounts to global peers due to what they say is a complex ownership structure, poor corporate governance and inefficient cash management. The hope is that a major restructuring would address those concerns and boost the company’s value.Samsung executives did not elaborate on the restructuring in a conference call on Tuesday.But under a restructuring, investors would expect the Lees and affiliates in the Samsung group of companies to exchange their operating company shares for stock in the holding firm, strengthening their grip.Samsung Electronics would then return more capital to shareholders, investors say. Such a move would boost earnings for Samsung Group firms and the Lee heirs, who face a multi-billion dollar inheritance tax in the event that 74-year-old Samsung Group patriarch Lee Kun-hee dies. The senior Lee has been in hospital since May 2014 following a heart attack.Henderson’s Duhra said the asset manager would be satisfied with a restructuring if it addresses “decades of inefficient structures, poor governance and weak corporate behavior towards minority shareholders.”Samsung said it would increase dividends for 2016 by 36 percent to 28,500 won ($24.36) per share, and buy back and cancel additional shares in January 2017 with whatever excess free cash remains from 2016.The company also said it needed to maintain a net cash position of between 65 trillion won and 70 trillion won, suggesting it is not likely to pay the special dividend sought by Elliott.Additional reporting by Michael Flaherty in NEW YORK; Nichola Saminather and Anshuman Daga in SINGAPORE; Editing by Miyoung Kim, Stephen Coates and Paul SimaoOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",
