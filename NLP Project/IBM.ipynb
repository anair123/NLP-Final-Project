       "      <td>la  Guzman5 Min ReadNEW YORK (LPC) - Bank lenders for high-quality US companies are taking different refinancing avenues as they seek to extend maturities on billions of US dollars in loans at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has made liquidity a top priority.FILE PHOTO: An empty Times Square is seen on the street following the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in New York City, U.S., March 18, 2020. REUTERS/Jeenah MoonCorporations that historically kept their credit agreements intact while extending maturities are now making significant changes to the loan documents accepting risk-mitigating concessions on pricing, terms and the loans’ longevity, while others seem exempt from the new requirements.Gilead Sciences, IBM and Ford Motor Co have tapped the market recently, with transactions that have pushed maturities out and ensured their access to capital following company-specific strategies that reflect different lenders’ perceptions of the credits and the changing times.“Not every company is going through the pandemic the same way because with more volatility there’s more differentiation, so you’re going to have different treatment and receptivity from the banks as a result,” a senior banker said.As the investment grade loan market grapples with tighter liquidity as a result of revolver drawdowns during the health crisis, lenders are rarely going beyond 364-day tenors for new deals. In the second quarter, investment grade refinancing dropped to a 10-year low of US$139bn, as borrowers largely passed on refinancing their multiyear revolvers. Five-year tenors dropped to 5% of total revolver volume in the second quarter, according to Refinitiv LPC data.The treatment is going to be dependent on the credit rating, the company’s performance and the sector, bankers agreed.In late June, A3/A rated Gilead refinanced a US$2.5bn, five-year credit agreement that was set to mature in May 2021. The terms on the facility remained the same with pricing at 87.5bp over Libor, according to Refinitiv LPC data. The proceeds of the loan are for general purposes, according to the data.The biopharmaceutical company is developing clinical trials of an antiviral Covid-19 treatment called remdesivir. Government support for the drug and the potential for profit likely helped seal the deal with lenders for the first five-year refinancing since the pandemic started.The fact that Gilead is an important capital markets issuer may have constituted an additional incentive for its bank group to commit to the long maturity during trying times.Spokespeople at Gilead and Bank of America, the administrative agent on the prior credit facility, declined to comment.Meanwhile, household name IBM took a different path and extended its credit facilities by signing a new US$2.5bn 364-day loan and extending the maturities on its US$2.5bn three-year credit agreement and US$10.25bn five-year credit agreements by two years, rather than completely refinancing. The A2/A rated technology giant withdrew its 2020 annual forecast as the pandemic impacted second quarter revenues.B+/Ba2 rated Ford, which lost its investment grade status in March due to the outbreak’s economic fallout, is on the opposite side of the spectrum as it seeks to extend maturities on US$5.35bn in existing loans.After pulling its refinancing plans for US$15.4bn in loans earlier this year, the B+/Ba2 rated automaker is currently in market looking to extend a more modestly-sized amount.As it looks to push out maturities on a US$3.35bn three-year revolving credit and a US$2bn three-year revolver for another year, the company will leave a US$10.05bn five-year revolver and US$1.5bn term loan unchanged.The lenders who agree to the extensions will receive a 40bp fee, which shows the large incentive the company had to offer to have banks stick with the company, which saw a 33.3% drop in US sales in the second quarter.“We’re all hoping for a better tomorrow,” said Robert Danziger, managing director of debt capital markets at MUFG. “Companies are positioning themselves to address immediate, short term liquidity needs now. In this way, rather than breaking a lot of relationship glass, they can wait for things to improve further in the bank market (hopefully in the not too distant future) and they can go back to pushing out tenors and refining pricing.”Reporting by Daniela Guzman; Editing by Michelle Sierra and Kristen Haunss.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- Billionaire investor Bill Gross is predicting that value stocks like IBM IBM.N and Altria Group MO.N are likely to fare better than growth stocks like Apple AAPL.O or Amazon.com AMZN.O in the near term, due to a correlation with real interest rates.U.S. real yields - which adjust for inflation - have been declining in response to the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary actions over the past few months to limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) US10YTIP=RR has been trading with a negative yield since late March and is now minus 0.803%, near an all-time-low. Gross, who co-founded Pacific Investment Management Company, then spent four years at Janus Henderson before leaving in 2019 to manage his own money, said that the reason that the \"Fab 5 stocks\" and growth stocks in general had done \"so fabulously well\" centers on falling real interest rates that \"are still reaching historic lows.\" Gross is referring to a clutch of high-performing stocks: Amazon, Facebook FB.O, Apple, Netflix NFLX.O and Google's parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, according to his spokesperson. The yields of TIPS are highly correlated with growth stocks, but have far less of an effect on the prices of traditional value stocks, he wrote.The future price disparity of Microsoft MSFT.O, Apple and Amazon \"is subject to an ongoing decline in real rates, which to my mind, have seen their best days,\" Gross said. \"Value stocks, versus growth stocks, should be an investor's preference in the near-term future,\" he writes.Gross said that as well as IBM and Altria, he likes stocks such as midstream company Enterprise Products Partners EPD.N and pharmaceutical giant AbbVie ABBV.N.“Happiness is a healthy body, sinking a few 10-foot putts, and investing in value, versus the ‘Fab 5’,” wrote Gross, who also said he was COVID-19 free.Reporting by Kate Duguid; Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Megan Davies and Christopher CushingOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File PhotoThe company’s shares rose 5% in after-hours trading.IBM has jettisoned some of its legacy business to focus on the high-margin cloud computing business, an area that has seen a lot of action in recent years as companies ramp up their digital shift to boost efficiency.“The trend we see in the market is clear. Clients want to modernize apps, move more workloads to the cloud and automate IT tasks,” IBM’s new boss Arvind Krishna said on a post-earnings call with analysts.Revenue from the cloud business, previously headed by Krishna, rose 30% to $6.3 billion in the second quarter.Krishna took over as chief executive officer from Ginni Rometty in April, while appointing former Bank of America Corp's BAC.N top technology executive, Howard Boville, as the new head of the cloud business.IBM’s global business services unit was impacted as clients cut or delayed spending on discretionary projects due to COVID-19, CFO James Kavanaugh told Reuters. Sales in the unit fell 7% to $3.9 billion.While Western Europe and Asia Pacific showed a pickup in client spending during June, U.S. and Latin America customers pulled back as the pandemic impact got worse, Kavanaugh said.“From a client perspective, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises, which in total have been relatively more stable throughout the pandemic,” Kavanaugh said.IBM’s total revenue fell 5.4% to $18.12 billion, but came in above analysts’ estimates of $17.72 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, revenue declined 1.9%.Excluding items, the company earned $2.18 per share, above estimates of $2.07.Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju SamuelOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Carlo AllegriRevenue in Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment rose 17% to $13.4 billion, with 47% growth in the Azure component, which includes essential computing and storage services. Analysts on average had expected cloud revenue of $13.09 billion in the fourth quarter ended June 30, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Azure's growth is the most direct measure of performance against top cloud rival Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services, as Microsoft does not break out Azure's revenue by dollar amount. AWS posted revenue growth of 33% to $10.2 billion, which analysts believe exceeds Azure's total, for the quarter ended March 31. International Business Machines Corp IBM.N, another Microsoft rival, this week beat Wall Street expectations with strong cloud growth.Beyond Azure, Microsoft’s results showed how the novel coronavirus is both helping and hurting Microsoft.Businesses are investing in cloud technology for remote work, and the video game Minecraft scored a record 132 million monthly active users as families worked and played from home. But Microsoft’s forecast for some versions of its Office software slightly missed expectations because of weak sales to struggling small and mid-sized businesses.“No one can take away from the fact that GDP is going to be negative,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella told investors on the company’s earnings call, referring to U.S. Gross Domestic Product.Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said 12% commercial bookings growth, which reflects corporate contracts for future software and services, was roughly unchanged from the previous quarter and beat company estimates. The figure signals that customers are keeping long-term technology spending plans intact.“Our strong position in the cloud has allowed us to have good results and support our customers as they work on the next couple of years of digital transformation,” Hood said in an interview.Microsoft's total revenue rose 13% to $38.03 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $36.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (bit.ly/3jxrriP)The growth was powered by its More Personal Computing unit as more people worldwide used its products to work on Windows PCs and play games on Xboxes during lockdowns. Revenue from the unit, the largest by sales, rose 14% to $12.9 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $11.46 billion.Microsoft said its professional networking site, LinkedIn, was hurt by the weak job market and advertising spending cuts.Net income fell to $11.20 billion, or $1.46 per share, from $13.19 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier.Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Richard ChangOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "0  la  Guzman5 Min ReadNEW YORK (LPC) - Bank lenders for high-quality US companies are taking different refinancing avenues as they seek to extend maturities on billions of US dollars in loans at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has made liquidity a top priority.FILE PHOTO: An empty Times Square is seen on the street following the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in New York City, U.S., March 18, 2020. REUTERS/Jeenah MoonCorporations that historically kept their credit agreements intact while extending maturities are now making significant changes to the loan documents accepting risk-mitigating concessions on pricing, terms and the loans’ longevity, while others seem exempt from the new requirements.Gilead Sciences, IBM and Ford Motor Co have tapped the market recently, with transactions that have pushed maturities out and ensured their access to capital following company-specific strategies that reflect different lenders’ perceptions of the credits and the changing times.“Not every company is going through the pandemic the same way because with more volatility there’s more differentiation, so you’re going to have different treatment and receptivity from the banks as a result,” a senior banker said.As the investment grade loan market grapples with tighter liquidity as a result of revolver drawdowns during the health crisis, lenders are rarely going beyond 364-day tenors for new deals. In the second quarter, investment grade refinancing dropped to a 10-year low of US$139bn, as borrowers largely passed on refinancing their multiyear revolvers. Five-year tenors dropped to 5% of total revolver volume in the second quarter, according to Refinitiv LPC data.The treatment is going to be dependent on the credit rating, the company’s performance and the sector, bankers agreed.In late June, A3/A rated Gilead refinanced a US$2.5bn, five-year credit agreement that was set to mature in May 2021. The terms on the facility remained the same with pricing at 87.5bp over Libor, according to Refinitiv LPC data. The proceeds of the loan are for general purposes, according to the data.The biopharmaceutical company is developing clinical trials of an antiviral Covid-19 treatment called remdesivir. Government support for the drug and the potential for profit likely helped seal the deal with lenders for the first five-year refinancing since the pandemic started.The fact that Gilead is an important capital markets issuer may have constituted an additional incentive for its bank group to commit to the long maturity during trying times.Spokespeople at Gilead and Bank of America, the administrative agent on the prior credit facility, declined to comment.Meanwhile, household name IBM took a different path and extended its credit facilities by signing a new US$2.5bn 364-day loan and extending the maturities on its US$2.5bn three-year credit agreement and US$10.25bn five-year credit agreements by two years, rather than completely refinancing. The A2/A rated technology giant withdrew its 2020 annual forecast as the pandemic impacted second quarter revenues.B+/Ba2 rated Ford, which lost its investment grade status in March due to the outbreak’s economic fallout, is on the opposite side of the spectrum as it seeks to extend maturities on US$5.35bn in existing loans.After pulling its refinancing plans for US$15.4bn in loans earlier this year, the B+/Ba2 rated automaker is currently in market looking to extend a more modestly-sized amount.As it looks to push out maturities on a US$3.35bn three-year revolving credit and a US$2bn three-year revolver for another year, the company will leave a US$10.05bn five-year revolver and US$1.5bn term loan unchanged.The lenders who agree to the extensions will receive a 40bp fee, which shows the large incentive the company had to offer to have banks stick with the company, which saw a 33.3% drop in US sales in the second quarter.“We’re all hoping for a better tomorrow,” said Robert Danziger, managing director of debt capital markets at MUFG. “Companies are positioning themselves to address immediate, short term liquidity needs now. In this way, rather than breaking a lot of relationship glass, they can wait for things to improve further in the bank market (hopefully in the not too distant future) and they can go back to pushing out tenors and refining pricing.”Reporting by Daniela Guzman; Editing by Michelle Sierra and Kristen Haunss.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.   \n",
       "1   - Billionaire investor Bill Gross is predicting that value stocks like IBM IBM.N and Altria Group MO.N are likely to fare better than growth stocks like Apple AAPL.O or Amazon.com AMZN.O in the near term, due to a correlation with real interest rates.U.S. real yields - which adjust for inflation - have been declining in response to the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary actions over the past few months to limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) US10YTIP=RR has been trading with a negative yield since late March and is now minus 0.803%, near an all-time-low. Gross, who co-founded Pacific Investment Management Company, then spent four years at Janus Henderson before leaving in 2019 to manage his own money, said that the reason that the \"Fab 5 stocks\" and growth stocks in general had done \"so fabulously well\" centers on falling real interest rates that \"are still reaching historic lows.\" Gross is referring to a clutch of high-performing stocks: Amazon, Facebook FB.O, Apple, Netflix NFLX.O and Google's parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, according to his spokesperson. The yields of TIPS are highly correlated with growth stocks, but have far less of an effect on the prices of traditional value stocks, he wrote.The future price disparity of Microsoft MSFT.O, Apple and Amazon \"is subject to an ongoing decline in real rates, which to my mind, have seen their best days,\" Gross said. \"Value stocks, versus growth stocks, should be an investor's preference in the near-term future,\" he writes.Gross said that as well as IBM and Altria, he likes stocks such as midstream company Enterprise Products Partners EPD.N and pharmaceutical giant AbbVie ABBV.N.“Happiness is a healthy body, sinking a few 10-foot putts, and investing in value, versus the ‘Fab 5’,” wrote Gross, who also said he was COVID-19 free.Reporting by Kate Duguid; Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Megan Davies and Christopher CushingOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "2   - International Business Machines Corp IBM.N beat estimates for second-quarter profit on Monday and signaled that demand in its cloud computing business would get a boost as large corporations accelerate their digital shift due to the coronavirus crisis.FILE PHOTO: A man stands near an IBM logo at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 25, 2019.    REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File PhotoThe company’s shares rose 5% in after-hours trading.IBM has jettisoned some of its legacy business to focus on the high-margin cloud computing business, an area that has seen a lot of action in recent years as companies ramp up their digital shift to boost efficiency.“The trend we see in the market is clear. Clients want to modernize apps, move more workloads to the cloud and automate IT tasks,” IBM’s new boss Arvind Krishna said on a post-earnings call with analysts.Revenue from the cloud business, previously headed by Krishna, rose 30% to $6.3 billion in the second quarter.Krishna took over as chief executive officer from Ginni Rometty in April, while appointing former Bank of America Corp's BAC.N top technology executive, Howard Boville, as the new head of the cloud business.IBM’s global business services unit was impacted as clients cut or delayed spending on discretionary projects due to COVID-19, CFO James Kavanaugh told Reuters. Sales in the unit fell 7% to $3.9 billion.While Western Europe and Asia Pacific showed a pickup in client spending during June, U.S. and Latin America customers pulled back as the pandemic impact got worse, Kavanaugh said.“From a client perspective, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises, which in total have been relatively more stable throughout the pandemic,” Kavanaugh said.IBM’s total revenue fell 5.4% to $18.12 billion, but came in above analysts’ estimates of $17.72 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

       "3   - Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O flagship cloud computing business Azure reported quarterly sales growth of under 50% for the first time ever on Wednesday, sending the tech giant's shares down 2%.The Microsoft store is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., June 26, 2020. REUTERS/Carlo AllegriRevenue in Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment rose 17% to $13.4 billion, with 47% growth in the Azure component, which includes essential computing and storage services. Analysts on average had expected cloud revenue of $13.09 billion in the fourth quarter ended June 30, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Azure's growth is the most direct measure of performance against top cloud rival Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services, as Microsoft does not break out Azure's revenue by dollar amount. AWS posted revenue growth of 33% to $10.2 billion, which analysts believe exceeds Azure's total, for the quarter ended March 31. International Business Machines Corp IBM.N, another Microsoft rival, this week beat Wall Street expectations with strong cloud growth.Beyond Azure, Microsoft’s results showed how the novel coronavirus is both helping and hurting Microsoft.Businesses are investing in cloud technology for remote work, and the video game Minecraft scored a record 132 million monthly active users as families worked and played from home. But Microsoft’s forecast for some versions of its Office software slightly missed expectations because of weak sales to struggling small and mid-sized businesses.“No one can take away from the fact that GDP is going to be negative,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella told investors on the company’s earnings call, referring to U.S. Gross Domestic Product.Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said 12% commercial bookings growth, which reflects corporate contracts for future software and services, was roughly unchanged from the previous quarter and beat company estimates. The figure signals that customers are keeping long-term technology spending plans intact.“Our strong position in the cloud has allowed us to have good results and support our customers as they work on the next couple of years of digital transformation,” Hood said in an interview.Microsoft's total revenue rose 13% to $38.03 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $36.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (bit.ly/3jxrriP)The growth was powered by its More Personal Computing unit as more people worldwide used its products to work on Windows PCs and play games on Xboxes during lockdowns. Revenue from the unit, the largest by sales, rose 14% to $12.9 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $11.46 billion.Microsoft said its professional networking site, LinkedIn, was hurt by the weak job market and advertising spending cuts.Net income fell to $11.20 billion, or $1.46 per share, from $13.19 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier.Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Richard ChangOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

REUTERS/Jeenah MoonCorporations that historically kept their credit agreements intact while extending maturities are now making significant changes to the loan documents accepting risk-mitigating concessions on pricing, terms and the loans’ longevity, while others seem exempt from the new requirements.Gilead Sciences, IBM and Ford Motor Co have tapped the market recently, with transactions that have pushed maturities out and ensured their access to capital following company-specific strategies that reflect different lenders’ perceptions of the credits and the changing times.“Not every company is going through the pandemic the same way because with more volatility there’s more differentiation, so you’re going to have different treatment and receptivity from the banks as a result,” a senior banker said.As the investment grade loan market grapples with tighter liquidity as a result of revolver drawdowns during the health crisis, lenders are rarely going beyond 364-day tenors for new deals. In the second quarter, investment grade refinancing dropped to a 10-year low of US$139bn, as borrowers largely passed on refinancing their multiyear revolvers. Five-year tenors dropped to 5% of total revolver volume in the second quarter, according to Refinitiv LPC data.The treatment is going to be dependent on the credit rating, the company’s performance and the sector, bankers agreed.In late June, A3/A rated Gilead refinanced a US$2.5bn, five-year credit agreement that was set to mature in May 2021. The terms on the facility remained the same with pricing at 87.5bp over Libor, according to Refinitiv LPC data. The proceeds of the loan are for general purposes, according to the data.The biopharmaceutical company is developing clinical trials of an antiviral Covid-19 treatment called remdesivir. Government support for the drug and the potential for profit likely helped seal the deal with lenders for the first five-year refinancing since the pandemic started.The fact that Gilead is an important capital markets issuer may have constituted an additional incentive for its bank group to commit to the long maturity during trying times.Spokespeople at Gilead and Bank of America, the administrative agent on the prior credit facility, declined to comment.Meanwhile, household name IBM took a different path and extended its credit facilities by signing a new US$2.5bn 364-day loan and extending the maturities on its US$2.5bn three-year credit agreement and US$10.25bn five-year credit agreements by two years, rather than completely refinancing. The A2/A rated technology giant withdrew its 2020 annual forecast as the pandemic impacted second quarter revenues.B+/Ba2 rated Ford, which lost its investment grade status in March due to the outbreak’s economic fallout, is on the opposite side of the spectrum as it seeks to extend maturities on US$5.35bn in existing loans.After pulling its refinancing plans for US$15.4bn in loans earlier this year, the B+/Ba2 rated automaker is currently in market looking to extend a more modestly-sized amount.As it looks to push out maturities on a US$3.35bn three-year revolving credit and a US$2bn three-year revolver for another year, the company will leave a US$10.05bn five-year revolver and US$1.5bn term loan unchanged.The lenders who agree to the extensions will receive a 40bp fee, which shows the large incentive the company had to offer to have banks stick with the company, which saw a 33.3% drop in US sales in the second quarter.“We’re all hoping for a better tomorrow,” said Robert Danziger, managing director of debt capital markets at MUFG. “Companies are positioning themselves to address immediate, short term liquidity needs now. In this way, rather than breaking a lot of relationship glass, they can wait for things to improve further in the bank market (hopefully in the not too distant future) and they can go back to pushing out tenors and refining pricing.”Reporting by Daniela Guzman; Editing by Michelle Sierra and Kristen Haunss.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- Billionaire investor Bill Gross is predicting that value stocks like IBM IBM.N and Altria Group MO.N are likely to fare better than growth stocks like Apple AAPL.O or Amazon.com AMZN.O in the near term, due to a correlation with real interest rates.U.S. real yields - which adjust for inflation - have been declining in response to the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary actions over the past few months to limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) US10YTIP=RR has been trading with a negative yield since late March and is now minus 0.803%, near an all-time-low. Gross, who co-founded Pacific Investment Management Company, then spent four years at Janus Henderson before leaving in 2019 to manage his own money, said that the reason that the \"Fab 5 stocks\" and growth stocks in general had done \"so fabulously well\" centers on falling real interest rates that \"are still reaching historic lows.\" Gross is referring to a clutch of high-performing stocks: Amazon, Facebook FB.O, Apple, Netflix NFLX.O and Google's parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, according to his spokesperson. The yields of TIPS are highly correlated with growth stocks, but have far less of an effect on the prices of traditional value stocks, he wrote.The future price disparity of Microsoft MSFT.O, Apple and Amazon \"is subject to an ongoing decline in real rates, which to my mind, have seen their best days,\" Gross said. \"Value stocks, versus growth stocks, should be an investor's preference in the near-term future,\" he writes.Gross said that as well as IBM and Altria, he likes stocks such as midstream company Enterprise Products Partners EPD.N and pharmaceutical giant AbbVie ABBV.N.“Happiness is a healthy body, sinking a few 10-foot putts, and investing in value, versus the ‘Fab 5’,” wrote Gross, who also said he was COVID-19 free.Reporting by Kate Duguid; Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Megan Davies and Christopher CushingOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File PhotoThe company’s shares rose 5% in after-hours trading.IBM has jettisoned some of its legacy business to focus on the high-margin cloud computing business, an area that has seen a lot of action in recent years as companies ramp up their digital shift to boost efficiency.“The trend we see in the market is clear. Clients want to modernize apps, move more workloads to the cloud and automate IT tasks,” IBM’s new boss Arvind Krishna said on a post-earnings call with analysts.Revenue from the cloud business, previously headed by Krishna, rose 30% to $6.3 billion in the second quarter.Krishna took over as chief executive officer from Ginni Rometty in April, while appointing former Bank of America Corp's BAC.N top technology executive, Howard Boville, as the new head of the cloud business.IBM’s global business services unit was impacted as clients cut or delayed spending on discretionary projects due to COVID-19, CFO James Kavanaugh told Reuters. Sales in the unit fell 7% to $3.9 billion.While Western Europe and Asia Pacific showed a pickup in client spending during June, U.S. and Latin America customers pulled back as the pandemic impact got worse, Kavanaugh said.“From a client perspective, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises, which in total have been relatively more stable throughout the pandemic,” Kavanaugh said.IBM’s total revenue fell 5.4% to $18.12 billion, but came in above analysts’ estimates of $17.72 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, revenue declined 1.9%.Excluding items, the company earned $2.18 per share, above estimates of $2.07.Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju SamuelOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O flagship cloud computing business Azure reported quarterly sales growth of under 50% for the first time ever on Wednesday, sending the tech giant's shares down 2%.The Microsoft store is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., June 26, 2020. REUTERS/Carlo AllegriRevenue in Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment rose 17% to $13.4 billion, with 47% growth in the Azure component, which includes essential computing and storage services. Analysts on average had expected cloud revenue of $13.09 billion in the fourth quarter ended June 30, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Azure's growth is the most direct measure of performance against top cloud rival Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services, as Microsoft does not break out Azure's revenue by dollar amount. AWS posted revenue growth of 33% to $10.2 billion, which analysts believe exceeds Azure's total, for the quarter ended March 31. International Business Machines Corp IBM.N, another Microsoft rival, this week beat Wall Street expectations with strong cloud growth.Beyond Azure, Microsoft’s results showed how the novel coronavirus is both helping and hurting Microsoft.Businesses are investing in cloud technology for remote work, and the video game Minecraft scored a record 132 million monthly active users as families worked and played from home. But Microsoft’s forecast for some versions of its Office software slightly missed expectations because of weak sales to struggling small and mid-sized businesses.“No one can take away from the fact that GDP is going to be negative,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella told investors on the company’s earnings call, referring to U.S. Gross Domestic Product.Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said 12% commercial bookings growth, which reflects corporate contracts for future software and services, was roughly unchanged from the previous quarter and beat company estimates. The figure signals that customers are keeping long-term technology spending plans intact.“Our strong position in the cloud has allowed us to have good results and support our customers as they work on the next couple of years of digital transformation,” Hood said in an interview.Microsoft's total revenue rose 13% to $38.03 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $36.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (bit.ly/3jxrriP)The growth was powered by its More Personal Computing unit as more people worldwide used its products to work on Windows PCs and play games on Xboxes during lockdowns. Revenue from the unit, the largest by sales, rose 14% to $12.9 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $11.46 billion.Microsoft said its professional networking site, LinkedIn, was hurt by the weak job market and advertising spending cuts.Net income fell to $11.20 billion, or $1.46 per share, from $13.19 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier.Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Richard ChangOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "0  la  Guzman5 Min ReadNEW YORK (LPC) - Bank lenders for high-quality US companies are taking different refinancing avenues as they seek to extend maturities on billions of US dollars in loans at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has made liquidity a top priority.FILE PHOTO: An empty Times Square is seen on the street following the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in New York City, U.S., March 18, 2020. REUTERS/Jeenah MoonCorporations that historically kept their credit agreements intact while extending maturities are now making significant changes to the loan documents accepting risk-mitigating concessions on pricing, terms and the loans’ longevity, while others seem exempt from the new requirements.Gilead Sciences, IBM and Ford Motor Co have tapped the market recently, with transactions that have pushed maturities out and ensured their access to capital following company-specific strategies that reflect different lenders’ perceptions of the credits and the changing times.“Not every company is going through the pandemic the same way because with more volatility there’s more differentiation, so you’re going to have different treatment and receptivity from the banks as a result,” a senior banker said.As the investment grade loan market grapples with tighter liquidity as a result of revolver drawdowns during the health crisis, lenders are rarely going beyond 364-day tenors for new deals. In the second quarter, investment grade refinancing dropped to a 10-year low of US$139bn, as borrowers largely passed on refinancing their multiyear revolvers. Five-year tenors dropped to 5% of total revolver volume in the second quarter, according to Refinitiv LPC data.The treatment is going to be dependent on the credit rating, the company’s performance and the sector, bankers agreed.In late June, A3/A rated Gilead refinanced a US$2.5bn, five-year credit agreement that was set to mature in May 2021. The terms on the facility remained the same with pricing at 87.5bp over Libor, according to Refinitiv LPC data. The proceeds of the loan are for general purposes, according to the data.The biopharmaceutical company is developing clinical trials of an antiviral Covid-19 treatment called remdesivir. Government support for the drug and the potential for profit likely helped seal the deal with lenders for the first five-year refinancing since the pandemic started.The fact that Gilead is an important capital markets issuer may have constituted an additional incentive for its bank group to commit to the long maturity during trying times.Spokespeople at Gilead and Bank of America, the administrative agent on the prior credit facility, declined to comment.Meanwhile, household name IBM took a different path and extended its credit facilities by signing a new US$2.5bn 364-day loan and extending the maturities on its US$2.5bn three-year credit agreement and US$10.25bn five-year credit agreements by two years, rather than completely refinancing. The A2/A rated technology giant withdrew its 2020 annual forecast as the pandemic impacted second quarter revenues.B+/Ba2 rated Ford, which lost its investment grade status in March due to the outbreak’s economic fallout, is on the opposite side of the spectrum as it seeks to extend maturities on US$5.35bn in existing loans.After pulling its refinancing plans for US$15.4bn in loans earlier this year, the B+/Ba2 rated automaker is currently in market looking to extend a more modestly-sized amount.As it looks to push out maturities on a US$3.35bn three-year revolving credit and a US$2bn three-year revolver for another year, the company will leave a US$10.05bn five-year revolver and US$1.5bn term loan unchanged.The lenders who agree to the extensions will receive a 40bp fee, which shows the large incentive the company had to offer to have banks stick with the company, which saw a 33.3% drop in US sales in the second quarter.“We’re all hoping for a better tomorrow,” said Robert Danziger, managing director of debt capital markets at MUFG. “Companies are positioning themselves to address immediate, short term liquidity needs now. In this way, rather than breaking a lot of relationship glass, they can wait for things to improve further in the bank market (hopefully in the not too distant future) and they can go back to pushing out tenors and refining pricing.”Reporting by Daniela Guzman; Editing by Michelle Sierra and Kristen Haunss.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.   \n",
       "1   - Billionaire investor Bill Gross is predicting that value stocks like IBM IBM.N and Altria Group MO.N are likely to fare better than growth stocks like Apple AAPL.O or Amazon.com AMZN.O in the near term, due to a correlation with real interest rates.U.S. real yields - which adjust for inflation - have been declining in response to the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary actions over the past few months to limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) US10YTIP=RR has been trading with a negative yield since late March and is now minus 0.803%, near an all-time-low. Gross, who co-founded Pacific Investment Management Company, then spent four years at Janus Henderson before leaving in 2019 to manage his own money, said that the reason that the \"Fab 5 stocks\" and growth stocks in general had done \"so fabulously well\" centers on falling real interest rates that \"are still reaching historic lows.\" Gross is referring to a clutch of high-performing stocks: Amazon, Facebook FB.O, Apple, Netflix NFLX.O and Google's parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, according to his spokesperson. The yields of TIPS are highly correlated with growth stocks, but have far less of an effect on the prices of traditional value stocks, he wrote.The future price disparity of Microsoft MSFT.O, Apple and Amazon \"is subject to an ongoing decline in real rates, which to my mind, have seen their best days,\" Gross said. \"Value stocks, versus growth stocks, should be an investor's preference in the near-term future,\" he writes.Gross said that as well as IBM and Altria, he likes stocks such as midstream company Enterprise Products Partners EPD.N and pharmaceutical giant AbbVie ABBV.N.“Happiness is a healthy body, sinking a few 10-foot putts, and investing in value, versus the ‘Fab 5’,” wrote Gross, who also said he was COVID-19 free.Reporting by Kate Duguid; Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Megan Davies and Christopher CushingOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "2   - International Business Machines Corp IBM.N beat estimates for second-quarter profit on Monday and signaled that demand in its cloud computing business would get a boost as large corporations accelerate their digital shift due to the coronavirus crisis.FILE PHOTO: A man stands near an IBM logo at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 25, 2019.    REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File PhotoThe company’s shares rose 5% in after-hours trading.IBM has jettisoned some of its legacy business to focus on the high-margin cloud computing business, an area that has seen a lot of action in recent years as companies ramp up their digital shift to boost efficiency.“The trend we see in the market is clear. Clients want to modernize apps, move more workloads to the cloud and automate IT tasks,” IBM’s new boss Arvind Krishna said on a post-earnings call with analysts.Revenue from the cloud business, previously headed by Krishna, rose 30% to $6.3 billion in the second quarter.Krishna took over as chief executive officer from Ginni Rometty in April, while appointing former Bank of America Corp's BAC.N top technology executive, Howard Boville, as the new head of the cloud business.IBM’s global business services unit was impacted as clients cut or delayed spending on discretionary projects due to COVID-19, CFO James Kavanaugh told Reuters. Sales in the unit fell 7% to $3.9 billion.While Western Europe and Asia Pacific showed a pickup in client spending during June, U.S. and Latin America customers pulled back as the pandemic impact got worse, Kavanaugh said.“From a client perspective, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises, which in total have been relatively more stable throughout the pandemic,” Kavanaugh said.IBM’s total revenue fell 5.4% to $18.12 billion, but came in above analysts’ estimates of $17.72 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

       "3   - Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O flagship cloud computing business Azure reported quarterly sales growth of under 50% for the first time ever on Wednesday, sending the tech giant's shares down 2%.The Microsoft store is pictured in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., June 26, 2020. REUTERS/Carlo AllegriRevenue in Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment rose 17% to $13.4 billion, with 47% growth in the Azure component, which includes essential computing and storage services. Analysts on average had expected cloud revenue of $13.09 billion in the fourth quarter ended June 30, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Azure's growth is the most direct measure of performance against top cloud rival Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services, as Microsoft does not break out Azure's revenue by dollar amount. AWS posted revenue growth of 33% to $10.2 billion, which analysts believe exceeds Azure's total, for the quarter ended March 31. International Business Machines Corp IBM.N, another Microsoft rival, this week beat Wall Street expectations with strong cloud growth.Beyond Azure, Microsoft’s results showed how the novel coronavirus is both helping and hurting Microsoft.Businesses are investing in cloud technology for remote work, and the video game Minecraft scored a record 132 million monthly active users as families worked and played from home. But Microsoft’s forecast for some versions of its Office software slightly missed expectations because of weak sales to struggling small and mid-sized businesses.“No one can take away from the fact that GDP is going to be negative,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella told investors on the company’s earnings call, referring to U.S. Gross Domestic Product.Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said 12% commercial bookings growth, which reflects corporate contracts for future software and services, was roughly unchanged from the previous quarter and beat company estimates. The figure signals that customers are keeping long-term technology spending plans intact.“Our strong position in the cloud has allowed us to have good results and support our customers as they work on the next couple of years of digital transformation,” Hood said in an interview.Microsoft's total revenue rose 13% to $38.03 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $36.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (bit.ly/3jxrriP)The growth was powered by its More Personal Computing unit as more people worldwide used its products to work on Windows PCs and play games on Xboxes during lockdowns. Revenue from the unit, the largest by sales, rose 14% to $12.9 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $11.46 billion.Microsoft said its professional networking site, LinkedIn, was hurt by the weak job market and advertising spending cuts.Net income fell to $11.20 billion, or $1.46 per share, from $13.19 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier.Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Richard ChangOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
