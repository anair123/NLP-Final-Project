REUTERS/Jeenah MoonCorporations that historically kept their credit agreements intact while extending maturities are now making significant changes to the loan documents accepting risk-mitigating concessions on pricing, terms and the loans’ longevity, while others seem exempt from the new requirements.Gilead Sciences, IBM and Ford Motor Co have tapped the market recently, with transactions that have pushed maturities out and ensured their access to capital following company-specific strategies that reflect different lenders’ perceptions of the credits and the changing times.“Not every company is going through the pandemic the same way because with more volatility there’s more differentiation, so you’re going to have different treatment and receptivity from the banks as a result,” a senior banker said.As the investment grade loan market grapples with tighter liquidity as a result of revolver drawdowns during the health crisis, lenders are rarely going beyond 364-day tenors for new deals. In the second quarter, investment grade refinancing dropped to a 10-year low of US$139bn, as borrowers largely passed on refinancing their multiyear revolvers. Five-year tenors dropped to 5% of total revolver volume in the second quarter, according to Refinitiv LPC data.The treatment is going to be dependent on the credit rating, the company’s performance and the sector, bankers agreed.In late June, A3/A rated Gilead refinanced a US$2.5bn, five-year credit agreement that was set to mature in May 2021. The terms on the facility remained the same with pricing at 87.5bp over Libor, according to Refinitiv LPC data. The proceeds of the loan are for general purposes, according to the data.The biopharmaceutical company is developing clinical trials of an antiviral Covid-19 treatment called remdesivir. Government support for the drug and the potential for profit likely helped seal the deal with lenders for the first five-year refinancing since the pandemic started.The fact that Gilead is an important capital markets issuer may have constituted an additional incentive for its bank group to commit to the long maturity during trying times.Spokespeople at Gilead and Bank of America, the administrative agent on the prior credit facility, declined to comment.Meanwhile, household name IBM took a different path and extended its credit facilities by signing a new US$2.5bn 364-day loan and extending the maturities on its US$2.5bn three-year credit agreement and US$10.25bn five-year credit agreements by two years, rather than completely refinancing. The A2/A rated technology giant withdrew its 2020 annual forecast as the pandemic impacted second quarter revenues.B+/Ba2 rated Ford, which lost its investment grade status in March due to the outbreak’s economic fallout, is on the opposite side of the spectrum as it seeks to extend maturities on US$5.35bn in existing loans.After pulling its refinancing plans for US$15.4bn in loans earlier this year, the B+/Ba2 rated automaker is currently in market looking to extend a more modestly-sized amount.As it looks to push out maturities on a US$3.35bn three-year revolving credit and a US$2bn three-year revolver for another year, the company will leave a US$10.05bn five-year revolver and US$1.5bn term loan unchanged.The lenders who agree to the extensions will receive a 40bp fee, which shows the large incentive the company had to offer to have banks stick with the company, which saw a 33.3% drop in US sales in the second quarter.“We’re all hoping for a better tomorrow,” said Robert Danziger, managing director of debt capital markets at MUFG. “Companies are positioning themselves to address immediate, short term liquidity needs now. In this way, rather than breaking a lot of relationship glass, they can wait for things to improve further in the bank market (hopefully in the not too distant future) and they can go back to pushing out tenors and refining pricing.”Reporting by Daniela Guzman; Editing by Michelle Sierra and Kristen Haunss.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- Billionaire investor Bill Gross is predicting that value stocks like IBM IBM.N and Altria Group MO.N are likely to fare better than growth stocks like Apple AAPL.O or Amazon.com AMZN.O in the near term, due to a correlation with real interest rates.U.S. real yields - which adjust for inflation - have been declining in response to the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary actions over the past few months to limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) US10YTIP=RR has been trading with a negative yield since late March and is now minus 0.803%, near an all-time-low. Gross, who co-founded Pacific Investment Management Company, then spent four years at Janus Henderson before leaving in 2019 to manage his own money, said that the reason that the \"Fab 5 stocks\" and growth stocks in general had done \"so fabulously well\" centers on falling real interest rates that \"are still reaching historic lows.\" Gross is referring to a clutch of high-performing stocks: Amazon, Facebook FB.O, Apple, Netflix NFLX.O and Google's parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, according to his spokesperson. The yields of TIPS are highly correlated with growth stocks, but have far less of an effect on the prices of traditional value stocks, he wrote.The future price disparity of Microsoft MSFT.O, Apple and Amazon \"is subject to an ongoing decline in real rates, which to my mind, have seen their best days,\" Gross said. \"Value stocks, versus growth stocks, should be an investor's preference in the near-term future,\" he writes.Gross said that as well as IBM and Altria, he likes stocks such as midstream company Enterprise Products Partners EPD.N and pharmaceutical giant AbbVie ABBV.N.“Happiness is a healthy body, sinking a few 10-foot putts, and investing in value, versus the ‘Fab 5’,” wrote Gross, who also said he was COVID-19 free.Reporting by Kate Duguid; Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Megan Davies and Christopher CushingOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File PhotoThe company’s shares rose 5% in after-hours trading.IBM has jettisoned some of its legacy business to focus on the high-margin cloud computing business, an area that has seen a lot of action in recent years as companies ramp up their digital shift to boost efficiency.“The trend we see in the market is clear. Clients want to modernize apps, move more workloads to the cloud and automate IT tasks,” IBM’s new boss Arvind Krishna said on a post-earnings call with analysts.Revenue from the cloud business, previously headed by Krishna, rose 30% to $6.3 billion in the second quarter.Krishna took over as chief executive officer from Ginni Rometty in April, while appointing former Bank of America Corp's BAC.N top technology executive, Howard Boville, as the new head of the cloud business.IBM’s global business services unit was impacted as clients cut or delayed spending on discretionary projects due to COVID-19, CFO James Kavanaugh told Reuters. Sales in the unit fell 7% to $3.9 billion.While Western Europe and Asia Pacific showed a pickup in client spending during June, U.S. and Latin America customers pulled back as the pandemic impact got worse, Kavanaugh said.“From a client perspective, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises, which in total have been relatively more stable throughout the pandemic,” Kavanaugh said.IBM’s total revenue fell 5.4% to $18.12 billion, but came in above analysts’ estimates of $17.72 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, revenue declined 1.9%.Excluding items, the company earned $2.18 per share, above estimates of $2.07.Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju SamuelOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Carlo AllegriRevenue in Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment rose 17% to $13.4 billion, with 47% growth in the Azure component, which includes essential computing and storage services. Analysts on average had expected cloud revenue of $13.09 billion in the fourth quarter ended June 30, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Azure's growth is the most direct measure of performance against top cloud rival Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services, as Microsoft does not break out Azure's revenue by dollar amount. AWS posted revenue growth of 33% to $10.2 billion, which analysts believe exceeds Azure's total, for the quarter ended March 31. International Business Machines Corp IBM.N, another Microsoft rival, this week beat Wall Street expectations with strong cloud growth.Beyond Azure, Microsoft’s results showed how the novel coronavirus is both helping and hurting Microsoft.Businesses are investing in cloud technology for remote work, and the video game Minecraft scored a record 132 million monthly active users as families worked and played from home. But Microsoft’s forecast for some versions of its Office software slightly missed expectations because of weak sales to struggling small and mid-sized businesses.“No one can take away from the fact that GDP is going to be negative,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella told investors on the company’s earnings call, referring to U.S. Gross Domestic Product.Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said 12% commercial bookings growth, which reflects corporate contracts for future software and services, was roughly unchanged from the previous quarter and beat company estimates. The figure signals that customers are keeping long-term technology spending plans intact.“Our strong position in the cloud has allowed us to have good results and support our customers as they work on the next couple of years of digital transformation,” Hood said in an interview.Microsoft's total revenue rose 13% to $38.03 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $36.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (bit.ly/3jxrriP)The growth was powered by its More Personal Computing unit as more people worldwide used its products to work on Windows PCs and play games on Xboxes during lockdowns.

The company said Monday that the Power10 chip has been designed to be faster at artificial intelligence computing tasks than its predecessor, doing such work up to 20 times faster than its previous generation of chip.Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Diane CraftOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Aly SongIn recent months, local governments and state firms such as China Telecom have announced plans and procurements aimed at fostering a home-grown tech ecosystem to displace gear from the likes of Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and IBM.An index tracking Chinese IT stocks .CSIINT has jumped nearly 30% this year, doubling blue-chip gains .CSI300.\"We're seeing more U.S. actions against China, and the future tends to be 'one world, two systems',\" said Wu Kan, portfolio manager at Soochow Securities Co, who has invested in local tech leaders including China National Software &amp; Service Co Ltd 600536.SS, China Greatwall Technology Group 000066.SZ and Beijing Kingsoft Office Software 688111.SS. “Any segment that faces decoupling risks represents big investment opportunities.”Some market watchers warn valuations of China tech stocks are getting frothy at roughly 60 times trailing earnings, noting Chinese firms could take years to catch-up to established global players. But Wu said price levels are justified by growth potential and direct government backing.The Trump administration has recently strengthened restrictions on China’s Huawei Technologies and sanctioned China-owned apps TikTok and WeChat. Washington also rolled out a “Clean Network” initiative to exclude Chinese tech firms perceived as threatening national security.Under U.S. pressure, Chinese vendors are poised to gain local market share, said Jie Lu, Robeco’s China research head.“China will ramp up the investment and R&amp;D intensity for critical industries such as semiconductors,” Lu said.Dongxing Securities predicted that a retooling would create a 1 trillion yuan ($144.46 billion) opportunity over the next three years for local vendors.KUNPENG PUSHLocal governments are rushing to form industry federations to promote the use of Huawei’s Kunpeng processing technologies.Last week, China Unicom's Wuchang subsidiary struck a partnership with Huanghe Technology, which makes servers and PCs using Kunpeng technologies. In May, IT distributer Digital China 000034.SZ said it was building plants to make PCs and servers using Kunpeng CPUs. Also in May, China Telecom said it would procure up to 56,314 servers in 2020, one-fifth of them using Kunpeng and Hygon Dhyana chips, which rival U.S. brands Intel and AMD in a move seen as a gesture of Beijing’s localisation push.“China must promote domestic replacement to avoid being strangled, even as its current technology lags by far,” Zhang Chi, chairman of Xin Ding Capital said during an investor roadshow for Haigon Information Technology, maker of Hygon Dhyana chips.Some 95% of Chinese servers use CPUs from Intel.It would be disaster, Zhang said, “if one day, Trump bans Intel from selling CPUs to China.”Zhang expects Chinese government agencies to replace all computers using U.S. chips in the next five years, echoing views of many analysts.National Software &amp; Service, which makes operating systems that compete with Windows and middleware that aims to rival IBM and Oracle, expects revenue this year to jump 70% to 10 billion yuan.Beijing Kingsoft Office Software this week posted a 143% jump in first-half profit and said China’s need for information security is boosting sales.Beijing Baolande Software Corp 688058.SS also sees governments and finance clients as new growth engines thanks to replacement demand, investor relations official Guo Xing said. But Brian Bandsma, New York-based portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management, said the opportunities in replacement demand would be limited, given less competitive local offerings and what may be longer-than-expected adoption rates.“Companies like Microsoft have been around for decades and have a very complex piece of software that’s being heavily used by multiple industries. There’s a reason why Microsoft is in the position it’s in,” said Bandsma.“There’s probably too much optimism baked into valuations in terms of what these local companies are going to get out of China’s focus on domestic suppliers.”(This story corrects to fix typographical error in company name in 4th to last paragraph)Reporting by Samuel Shen and Josh Horwitz; Editing by Tony Munroe and Kim CoghillOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- The U.S. Department of Energy on Wednesday said it will provide $625 million over the next five years for five newly formed quantum information research hubs as it tries to keep ahead of competing nations like China on the emerging technology.The funding is part of $1.2 billion earmarked in the National Quantum Initiative Act in 2018.Researchers believe quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today’s advanced supercomputers, making possible potential tasks ranging from mapping complex molecular structures and chemical reactions to boosting the power of artificial intelligence.“It’s absolutely imperative the United States continues to lead the world in AI and quantum. We know our adversaries around the world are pursuing their own advances,” U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios said during a White House press briefing announcing the quantum information research funding and another $100 million plus investment into the National Science Foundation’s AI Research Institutes.The five research hubs are each led by the Energy Department’s Argonne, Brookhaven, Fermi, Lawrence Berkeley and Oak Ridge national laboratories. The hubs are comprised of top research universities, other national labs and big tech companies in the quantum computing space such as International Business Machines Corp IBM.N, Intel Corp INTC.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, and quantum computer startups Rigetti &amp; Co and ColdQuanta Inc. An Italian research lab and a Canadian university are also taking part.Missing from the list are Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, considered one of the top firms in quantum computing, and Honeywell International Inc HON.N, which unveiled its quantum computing business in the past year. The Energy Department spokesperson declined to comment on whether they had been part of a proposal that didn’t receive funding.Paul Dabbar, under secretary for science at the Energy Department, said the private sector contributed another $340 million worth of labor, equipment, lab space and other assets to the project.Reporting by Jane Lanhee Lee; Editing by Leslie AdlerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Leah Millis The Internet Association said in a filing that the Trump administration petition filed in August seeking new rules “is misguided, lacks grounding in law, and poses serious public policy concerns.” It said new FCC rules could result in a loss of legal protections for removing “fraudulent schemes, scams, dangerous content promoting suicide or eating disorders to teens, and a wide range of other types of ‘otherwise objectionable’ content.”The Consumer Technology Association, which represents companies like IBM, Microsoft and Sony, also blasted the effort, saying it would “make compliance all but impossible.”“It is shocking that our own government would seek to undermine a law that has led to unprecedented American innovation, with massive benefits for our consumers and economy,” said Michael Petricone, a CTA official.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai dismissed calls from the two Democrats on the agency’s five-member commission to reject the petition without public comment. He has declined comment on the petition’s merits.President Donald Trump directed the Commerce Department to file the petition after Twitter Inc in May warned readers to fact-check his posts about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting.Facebook , Twitter and Google’s YouTube earlier pulled a post by Trump for violating their COVID-19 misinformation policies.The petition asks the FCC to limit protections for social media companies under Section 230, a provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users and allows them to remove lawful but objectionable posts.AT&amp;T Inc did not take a position on what action the FCC should take but said in comments “we support the growing consensus that online platforms should be more accountable for, and more transparent about, the decisions that fundamentally shape American society today.”Trump, a Republican running for re-election, has repeatedly expressed anger at social media companies.In August, the White House abruptly pulled the nomination of FCC Commissioner Mike O’Rielly for a new term just days after he questioned the effort to regulate social media companies’ editorial decisions.Reporting by David Shepardson and Nandita Bose; Editing by Leslie Adler and Alistair BellOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- Top oilfield service provider Schlumberger NV said Tuesday it will tap technology from International Business Machines Corp to bring oilfield software to countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that have strict data sovereignty laws.Schlumberger develops software called Delfi that energy producers use to locate and extract oil more efficiently. The company is shifting toward delivering Delfi from cloud-based or distributed servers, tapping providers such as Alphabet Inc’s Google and Microsoft Corp.Some countries, however, do not have any data centers offered by those public cloud providers and have laws requiring data to be stored locally. That means Schlumberger’s cloud-based software must be run on a locally run, private data center, or on a “hybrid” of public clouds and private data centers.Under the deal announced Tuesday, Schlumberger will use an IBM technology called Red Hat OpenShift to make such hybrids work easier.IBM’s technology forms a layer between Schlumberger’s Delfi software and the data centers where the software runs that allows the software to move back and forth to wherever customers need it.“We have realized in the last few quarters, last few months that we didn’t have the flexibility,” Schlumberger CEO Olivier Le Peuch told Reuters in an interview. “It has helped us expand the market access and expand the reach of our solution.”The data-heavy oil and gas industry has long been seen as slow to digitalize but in recent years has made a push to utilize cloud computing, artificial intelligence and internet-of-things technology in its operations.For IBM, the Schlumberger deal gives it a flagship oil-and-gas customer as it refines its cloud computing strategy, part of which has involved helping customers in fields such as financial services solve thorny technical and regulatory challenges.“The technology, once it’s in production, is what drives revenue for both of us,” IBM Chief Executive Arvind Krishna told Reuters.

REUTERS/Sergio PerezThe company said in a statement the United States should institute new export limits on “the type of facial recognition system most likely to be used in mass surveillance systems, racial profiling or other human rights violations.”In July, the Commerce Department had sought public comments on whether to adopt new export license requirements for facial recognition software and other biometric systems used in surveillance. Comments are due by Sept. 15.Christopher Padilla, IBM’s vice president for government and regulatory affairs, told Reuters the U.S. government should focus on “one to many” systems that could be used to pick dissidents out of a crowd or for mass surveillance, rather than “facial identification” systems that allow a user to unlock an iPhone or board an airplane.IBM said the Commerce Department should control “export of both the high-resolution cameras used to collect data and the software algorithms used to analyze and match that data against a database of images” and argued it should “limit the ability of certain foreign governments to obtain the large-scale computing components required to implement an integrated facial recognition system.”The company’s written comments did not identify specific governments but said “controls on the most powerful types of facial recognition technology should be focused on those countries that have a history of human rights abuses.”The Commerce Department’s July notice said China “has deployed facial recognition technology in the Xinjiang region, in which there has been repression, mass arbitrary detention and high technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other members of Muslim minority groups.”The department has added dozens of Chinese companies and entities to an economic blacklist that it said were implicated in human rights violations regarding China’s treatment of Uighurs, including video surveillance firm Hikvision 002415.SZ, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology.China has denied mistreating people in Xinjiang.IBM said the Commerce Department should also restrict access to online image databases that can be used to train facial recognition systems.In June, IBM told the U.S. Congress it would stop offering facial recognition software and opposes any use of such technology for purposes of mass surveillance and racial profiling. The company also called for new federal rules to hold police more accountable for misconduct.Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Muralikumar AnantharamanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- International Business Machines Corp IBM.N is splitting itself into two public companies, capping a years-long effort by the world's first big computing firm to diversify away from its legacy businesses to focus on high-margin cloud computing.IBM will list its IT infrastructure services unit, which provides technical support for 4,600 clients in 115 countries and has a backlog of $60 billion, as a separate company with a new name by the end of 2021.The new company will have 90,000 employees and its leadership structure will be decided in a few months, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters.IBM, which currently has more than 352,000 workers, said it expects to record nearly $5 billion in expenses related to the separation and operational changes.Investors cheered the surprise move by Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, the key architect behind IBM’s $34 billion acquisition of cloud company Red Hat last year, sending the company’s shares up 7%.“We divested networking back in the ‘90s, we divested PCs back in the 2000s, we divested semiconductors about five years ago because all of them didn’t necessarily play into the integrated value proposition,” Krishna said on a call with analysts.BIG BLUE’S NEW FOCUSIn a blog, Krishna called the move a “significant shift” in the 109-year-old company’s business model.“IBM is essentially getting rid of a shrinking, low-margin operation given the cannibalizing impact of automation and cloud, masking stronger growth for the rest of the operation,” Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri said.IBM, which has sought to make up for slowing software sales and seasonal demand for its mainframe servers, said it would now focus on open hybrid cloud and AI solutions that will account for more than half of its recurring revenues.Krishna, who replaced Ginni Rometty as CEO in April, said IBM’s software and solutions portfolio would account for the majority of company revenue after the separation.The company also said it expects third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion and an adjusted profit per share of $2.58, roughly in line with Street estimates.Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Ramakrishnan M.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- Wall Street’s main indexes rose on Tuesday as investors hoped for more stimulus from Washington, with Senate Republicans preparing to vote on a bill to help small businesses hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic.House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will also talk again on Tuesday, after a 53-minute telephone conversation on Monday “continued to narrow their differences” about the coronavirus aid package, a Pelosi spokesman said on Twitter.“It’s mostly hopes that we are going to get a stimulus deal going today and we will have money in the pockets of majority of Americans who are suffering most from the pandemic,” said David Trainer, chief executive officer of New Constructs, an investment research firm.Uncertainty over the fiscal stimulus weighed on Wall Street’s main indexes on Monday and analysts expect market turbulence to increase with only two weeks left until Election Day.Latest national opinion polls pointed to a victory for Democratic challenger Joe Biden, which would mean a cooling in global trade friction, but higher taxes for corporate America.Meanwhile, the third-quarter earnings season has gathered momentum. Of the 66 S&amp;P 500 companies that have reported results, 86.4% have topped expectations for earnings, according to Refinitiv IBES data.Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc gained 3.7% as it beat quarterly profit expectations, while consumer products giant Procter &amp; Gamble Co advanced 1.2% as it raised its full-year sales and earnings forecast.All 11 major S&amp;P sectors were up with financials tracking U.S. Treasury yields.At 11:23 a.m. ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 137.42 points, or 0.49%, to 28,332.84 and the gained 18.13 points, or 0.54%, to 3,445.05. The Nasdaq Composite gained 45.05 points, or 0.39%, to 11,523.93.Netflix Inc dipped 1% ahead of its third-quarter earnings report.International Business Machines Corp edged past estimates for quarterly revenue on Monday, bolstered by higher demand for its cloud services. The company’s shares, however, fell 3.3% after it stayed away from issuing a current-quarter forecast, citing economic uncertainty related to the pandemic.The U.S. Justice Department and 11 states filed an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet Inc’s Google for allegedly breaking the law in using its market power to fend off rivals. Alphabet’s shares were up 0.2%.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.90-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.36-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&amp;P index recorded 11 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 47 new highs and 17 new lows.

       "      <td>la  Guzman5 Min ReadNEW YORK (LPC) - Bank lenders for high-quality US companies are taking different refinancing avenues as they seek to extend maturities on billions of US dollars in loans at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has made liquidity a top priority.FILE PHOTO: An empty Times Square is seen on the street following the outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in New York City, U.S., March 18, 2020. REUTERS/Jeenah MoonCorporations that historically kept their credit agreements intact while extending maturities are now making significant changes to the loan documents accepting risk-mitigating concessions on pricing, terms and the loans’ longevity, while others seem exempt from the new requirements.Gilead Sciences, IBM and Ford Motor Co have tapped the market recently, with transactions that have pushed maturities out and ensured their access to capital following company-specific strategies that reflect different lenders’ perceptions of the credits and the changing times.“Not every company is going through the pandemic the same way because with more volatility there’s more differentiation, so you’re going to have different treatment and receptivity from the banks as a result,” a senior banker said.As the investment grade loan market grapples with tighter liquidity as a result of revolver drawdowns during the health crisis, lenders are rarely going beyond 364-day tenors for new deals. In the second quarter, investment grade refinancing dropped to a 10-year low of US$139bn, as borrowers largely passed on refinancing their multiyear revolvers. Five-year tenors dropped to 5% of total revolver volume in the second quarter, according to Refinitiv LPC data.The treatment is going to be dependent on the credit rating, the company’s performance and the sector, bankers agreed.In late June, A3/A rated Gilead refinanced a US$2.5bn, five-year credit agreement that was set to mature in May 2021. The terms on the facility remained the same with pricing at 87.5bp over Libor, according to Refinitiv LPC data. The proceeds of the loan are for general purposes, according to the data.The biopharmaceutical company is developing clinical trials of an antiviral Covid-19 treatment called remdesivir. Government support for the drug and the potential for profit likely helped seal the deal with lenders for the first five-year refinancing since the pandemic started.The fact that Gilead is an important capital markets issuer may have constituted an additional incentive for its bank group to commit to the long maturity during trying times.Spokespeople at Gilead and Bank of America, the administrative agent on the prior credit facility, declined to comment.Meanwhile, household name IBM took a different path and extended its credit facilities by signing a new US$2.5bn 364-day loan and extending the maturities on its US$2.5bn three-year credit agreement and US$10.25bn five-year credit agreements by two years, rather than completely refinancing. The A2/A rated technology giant withdrew its 2020 annual forecast as the pandemic impacted second quarter revenues.B+/Ba2 rated Ford, which lost its investment grade status in March due to the outbreak’s economic fallout, is on the opposite side of the spectrum as it seeks to extend maturities on US$5.35bn in existing loans.After pulling its refinancing plans for US$15.4bn in loans earlier this year, the B+/Ba2 rated automaker is currently in market looking to extend a more modestly-sized amount.As it looks to push out maturities on a US$3.35bn three-year revolving credit and a US$2bn three-year revolver for another year, the company will leave a US$10.05bn five-year revolver and US$1.5bn term loan unchanged.The lenders who agree to the extensions will receive a 40bp fee, which shows the large incentive the company had to offer to have banks stick with the company, which saw a 33.3% drop in US sales in the second quarter.“We’re all hoping for a better tomorrow,” said Robert Danziger, managing director of debt capital markets at MUFG. “Companies are positioning themselves to address immediate, short term liquidity needs now. In this way, rather than breaking a lot of relationship glass, they can wait for things to improve further in the bank market (hopefully in the not too distant future) and they can go back to pushing out tenors and refining pricing.”Reporting by Daniela Guzman; Editing by Michelle Sierra and Kristen Haunss.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- Billionaire investor Bill Gross is predicting that value stocks like IBM IBM.N and Altria Group MO.N are likely to fare better than growth stocks like Apple AAPL.O or Amazon.com AMZN.O in the near term, due to a correlation with real interest rates.U.S. real yields - which adjust for inflation - have been declining in response to the Federal Reserve's aggressive monetary actions over the past few months to limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The yield on the 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) US10YTIP=RR has been trading with a negative yield since late March and is now minus 0.803%, near an all-time-low. Gross, who co-founded Pacific Investment Management Company, then spent four years at Janus Henderson before leaving in 2019 to manage his own money, said that the reason that the \"Fab 5 stocks\" and growth stocks in general had done \"so fabulously well\" centers on falling real interest rates that \"are still reaching historic lows.\" Gross is referring to a clutch of high-performing stocks: Amazon, Facebook FB.O, Apple, Netflix NFLX.O and Google's parent Alphabet GOOGL.O, according to his spokesperson. The yields of TIPS are highly correlated with growth stocks, but have far less of an effect on the prices of traditional value stocks, he wrote.The future price disparity of Microsoft MSFT.O, Apple and Amazon \"is subject to an ongoing decline in real rates, which to my mind, have seen their best days,\" Gross said. \"Value stocks, versus growth stocks, should be an investor's preference in the near-term future,\" he writes.Gross said that as well as IBM and Altria, he likes stocks such as midstream company Enterprise Products Partners EPD.N and pharmaceutical giant AbbVie ABBV.N.“Happiness is a healthy body, sinking a few 10-foot putts, and investing in value, versus the ‘Fab 5’,” wrote Gross, who also said he was COVID-19 free.Reporting by Kate Duguid; Additional reporting by Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss; Editing by Megan Davies and Christopher CushingOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Sergio Perez/File PhotoThe company’s shares rose 5% in after-hours trading.IBM has jettisoned some of its legacy business to focus on the high-margin cloud computing business, an area that has seen a lot of action in recent years as companies ramp up their digital shift to boost efficiency.“The trend we see in the market is clear. Clients want to modernize apps, move more workloads to the cloud and automate IT tasks,” IBM’s new boss Arvind Krishna said on a post-earnings call with analysts.Revenue from the cloud business, previously headed by Krishna, rose 30% to $6.3 billion in the second quarter.Krishna took over as chief executive officer from Ginni Rometty in April, while appointing former Bank of America Corp's BAC.N top technology executive, Howard Boville, as the new head of the cloud business.IBM’s global business services unit was impacted as clients cut or delayed spending on discretionary projects due to COVID-19, CFO James Kavanaugh told Reuters. Sales in the unit fell 7% to $3.9 billion.While Western Europe and Asia Pacific showed a pickup in client spending during June, U.S. and Latin America customers pulled back as the pandemic impact got worse, Kavanaugh said.“From a client perspective, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises, which in total have been relatively more stable throughout the pandemic,” Kavanaugh said.IBM’s total revenue fell 5.4% to $18.12 billion, but came in above analysts’ estimates of $17.72 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, revenue declined 1.9%.Excluding items, the company earned $2.18 per share, above estimates of $2.07.Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju SamuelOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Carlo AllegriRevenue in Microsoft’s Intelligent Cloud segment rose 17% to $13.4 billion, with 47% growth in the Azure component, which includes essential computing and storage services. Analysts on average had expected cloud revenue of $13.09 billion in the fourth quarter ended June 30, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Azure's growth is the most direct measure of performance against top cloud rival Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Amazon Web Services, as Microsoft does not break out Azure's revenue by dollar amount. AWS posted revenue growth of 33% to $10.2 billion, which analysts believe exceeds Azure's total, for the quarter ended March 31. International Business Machines Corp IBM.N, another Microsoft rival, this week beat Wall Street expectations with strong cloud growth.Beyond Azure, Microsoft’s results showed how the novel coronavirus is both helping and hurting Microsoft.Businesses are investing in cloud technology for remote work, and the video game Minecraft scored a record 132 million monthly active users as families worked and played from home. But Microsoft’s forecast for some versions of its Office software slightly missed expectations because of weak sales to struggling small and mid-sized businesses.“No one can take away from the fact that GDP is going to be negative,” Chief Executive Satya Nadella told investors on the company’s earnings call, referring to U.S. Gross Domestic Product.Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said 12% commercial bookings growth, which reflects corporate contracts for future software and services, was roughly unchanged from the previous quarter and beat company estimates. The figure signals that customers are keeping long-term technology spending plans intact.“Our strong position in the cloud has allowed us to have good results and support our customers as they work on the next couple of years of digital transformation,” Hood said in an interview.Microsoft's total revenue rose 13% to $38.03 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $36.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (bit.ly/3jxrriP)The growth was powered by its More Personal Computing unit as more people worldwide used its products to work on Windows PCs and play games on Xboxes during lockdowns. Revenue from the unit, the largest by sales, rose 14% to $12.9 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $11.46 billion.Microsoft said its professional networking site, LinkedIn, was hurt by the weak job market and advertising spending cuts.Net income fell to $11.20 billion, or $1.46 per share, from $13.19 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier.Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel and Richard ChangOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

The company said Monday that the Power10 chip has been designed to be faster at artificial intelligence computing tasks than its predecessor, doing such work up to 20 times faster than its previous generation of chip.Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; editing by Diane CraftOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

REUTERS/Aly SongIn recent months, local governments and state firms such as China Telecom have announced plans and procurements aimed at fostering a home-grown tech ecosystem to displace gear from the likes of Intel, Microsoft, Oracle and IBM.An index tracking Chinese IT stocks .CSIINT has jumped nearly 30% this year, doubling blue-chip gains .CSI300.\"We're seeing more U.S. actions against China, and the future tends to be 'one world, two systems',\" said Wu Kan, portfolio manager at Soochow Securities Co, who has invested in local tech leaders including China National Software &amp; Service Co Ltd 600536.SS, China Greatwall Technology Group 000066.SZ and Beijing Kingsoft Office Software 688111.SS. “Any segment that faces decoupling risks represents big investment opportunities.”Some market watchers warn valuations of China tech stocks are getting frothy at roughly 60 times trailing earnings, noting Chinese firms could take years to catch-up to established global players. But Wu said price levels are justified by growth potential and direct government backing.The Trump administration has recently strengthened restrictions on China’s Huawei Technologies and sanctioned China-owned apps TikTok and WeChat. Washington also rolled out a “Clean Network” initiative to exclude Chinese tech firms perceived as threatening national security.Under U.S. pressure, Chinese vendors are poised to gain local market share, said Jie Lu, Robeco’s China research head.“China will ramp up the investment and R&amp;D intensity for critical industries such as semiconductors,” Lu said.Dongxing Securities predicted that a retooling would create a 1 trillion yuan ($144.46 billion) opportunity over the next three years for local vendors.KUNPENG PUSHLocal governments are rushing to form industry federations to promote the use of Huawei’s Kunpeng processing technologies.Last week, China Unicom's Wuchang subsidiary struck a partnership with Huanghe Technology, which makes servers and PCs using Kunpeng technologies. In May, IT distributer Digital China 000034.SZ said it was building plants to make PCs and servers using Kunpeng CPUs. Also in May, China Telecom said it would procure up to 56,314 servers in 2020, one-fifth of them using Kunpeng and Hygon Dhyana chips, which rival U.S. brands Intel and AMD in a move seen as a gesture of Beijing’s localisation push.“China must promote domestic replacement to avoid being strangled, even as its current technology lags by far,” Zhang Chi, chairman of Xin Ding Capital said during an investor roadshow for Haigon Information Technology, maker of Hygon Dhyana chips.Some 95% of Chinese servers use CPUs from Intel.It would be disaster, Zhang said, “if one day, Trump bans Intel from selling CPUs to China.”Zhang expects Chinese government agencies to replace all computers using U.S. chips in the next five years, echoing views of many analysts.National Software &amp; Service, which makes operating systems that compete with Windows and middleware that aims to rival IBM and Oracle, expects revenue this year to jump 70% to 10 billion yuan.Beijing Kingsoft Office Software this week posted a 143% jump in first-half profit and said China’s need for information security is boosting sales.Beijing Baolande Software Corp 688058.SS also sees governments and finance clients as new growth engines thanks to replacement demand, investor relations official Guo Xing said. But Brian Bandsma, New York-based portfolio manager at Vontobel Asset Management, said the opportunities in replacement demand would be limited, given less competitive local offerings and what may be longer-than-expected adoption rates.“Companies like Microsoft have been around for decades and have a very complex piece of software that’s being heavily used by multiple industries. There’s a reason why Microsoft is in the position it’s in,” said Bandsma.“There’s probably too much optimism baked into valuations in terms of what these local companies are going to get out of China’s focus on domestic suppliers.”(This story corrects to fix typographical error in company name in 4th to last paragraph)Reporting by Samuel Shen and Josh Horwitz; Editing by Tony Munroe and Kim CoghillOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- The U.S. Department of Energy on Wednesday said it will provide $625 million over the next five years for five newly formed quantum information research hubs as it tries to keep ahead of competing nations like China on the emerging technology.The funding is part of $1.2 billion earmarked in the National Quantum Initiative Act in 2018.Researchers believe quantum computers could operate millions of times faster than today’s advanced supercomputers, making possible potential tasks ranging from mapping complex molecular structures and chemical reactions to boosting the power of artificial intelligence.“It’s absolutely imperative the United States continues to lead the world in AI and quantum. We know our adversaries around the world are pursuing their own advances,” U.S. Chief Technology Officer Michael Kratsios said during a White House press briefing announcing the quantum information research funding and another $100 million plus investment into the National Science Foundation’s AI Research Institutes.The five research hubs are each led by the Energy Department’s Argonne, Brookhaven, Fermi, Lawrence Berkeley and Oak Ridge national laboratories. The hubs are comprised of top research universities, other national labs and big tech companies in the quantum computing space such as International Business Machines Corp IBM.N, Intel Corp INTC.O, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O, and quantum computer startups Rigetti &amp; Co and ColdQuanta Inc. An Italian research lab and a Canadian university are also taking part.Missing from the list are Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, considered one of the top firms in quantum computing, and Honeywell International Inc HON.N, which unveiled its quantum computing business in the past year. The Energy Department spokesperson declined to comment on whether they had been part of a proposal that didn’t receive funding.Paul Dabbar, under secretary for science at the Energy Department, said the private sector contributed another $340 million worth of labor, equipment, lab space and other assets to the project.Reporting by Jane Lanhee Lee; Editing by Leslie AdlerOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- A group representing major internet companies including Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google on Wednesday urged the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to reject a Trump administration bid to narrow the ability of social media companies to remove objectionable content.FILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a roundtable on \"Wisconsin Community Safety\" in Kenosha, Wisconsin, U.S., September 1, 2020. REUTERS/Leah Millis The Internet Association said in a filing that the Trump administration petition filed in August seeking new rules “is misguided, lacks grounding in law, and poses serious public policy concerns.” It said new FCC rules could result in a loss of legal protections for removing “fraudulent schemes, scams, dangerous content promoting suicide or eating disorders to teens, and a wide range of other types of ‘otherwise objectionable’ content.”The Consumer Technology Association, which represents companies like IBM, Microsoft and Sony, also blasted the effort, saying it would “make compliance all but impossible.”“It is shocking that our own government would seek to undermine a law that has led to unprecedented American innovation, with massive benefits for our consumers and economy,” said Michael Petricone, a CTA official.FCC Chairman Ajit Pai dismissed calls from the two Democrats on the agency’s five-member commission to reject the petition without public comment. He has declined comment on the petition’s merits.President Donald Trump directed the Commerce Department to file the petition after Twitter Inc in May warned readers to fact-check his posts about unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting.Facebook , Twitter and Google’s YouTube earlier pulled a post by Trump for violating their COVID-19 misinformation policies.The petition asks the FCC to limit protections for social media companies under Section 230, a provision of the 1996 Communications Decency Act that shields social media companies from liability for content posted by their users and allows them to remove lawful but objectionable posts.AT&amp;T Inc did not take a position on what action the FCC should take but said in comments “we support the growing consensus that online platforms should be more accountable for, and more transparent about, the decisions that fundamentally shape American society today.”Trump, a Republican running for re-election, has repeatedly expressed anger at social media companies.In August, the White House abruptly pulled the nomination of FCC Commissioner Mike O’Rielly for a new term just days after he questioned the effort to regulate social media companies’ editorial decisions.Reporting by David Shepardson and Nandita Bose; Editing by Leslie Adler and Alistair BellOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- Top oilfield service provider Schlumberger NV said Tuesday it will tap technology from International Business Machines Corp to bring oilfield software to countries such as Saudi Arabia and Russia that have strict data sovereignty laws.Schlumberger develops software called Delfi that energy producers use to locate and extract oil more efficiently. The company is shifting toward delivering Delfi from cloud-based or distributed servers, tapping providers such as Alphabet Inc’s Google and Microsoft Corp.Some countries, however, do not have any data centers offered by those public cloud providers and have laws requiring data to be stored locally. That means Schlumberger’s cloud-based software must be run on a locally run, private data center, or on a “hybrid” of public clouds and private data centers.Under the deal announced Tuesday, Schlumberger will use an IBM technology called Red Hat OpenShift to make such hybrids work easier.IBM’s technology forms a layer between Schlumberger’s Delfi software and the data centers where the software runs that allows the software to move back and forth to wherever customers need it.“We have realized in the last few quarters, last few months that we didn’t have the flexibility,” Schlumberger CEO Olivier Le Peuch told Reuters in an interview. “It has helped us expand the market access and expand the reach of our solution.”The data-heavy oil and gas industry has long been seen as slow to digitalize but in recent years has made a push to utilize cloud computing, artificial intelligence and internet-of-things technology in its operations.For IBM, the Schlumberger deal gives it a flagship oil-and-gas customer as it refines its cloud computing strategy, part of which has involved helping customers in fields such as financial services solve thorny technical and regulatory challenges.“The technology, once it’s in production, is what drives revenue for both of us,” IBM Chief Executive Arvind Krishna told Reuters.

       "      <td>- IBM Corp IBM.N said on Friday the U.S. Commerce Department should adopt new controls to limit the export of facial recognition systems to repressive regimes that can be used to commit human rights violations.FILE PHOTO: A man stands near an IBM logo at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, February 25, 2019.    REUTERS/Sergio PerezThe company said in a statement the United States should institute new export limits on “the type of facial recognition system most likely to be used in mass surveillance systems, racial profiling or other human rights violations.”In July, the Commerce Department had sought public comments on whether to adopt new export license requirements for facial recognition software and other biometric systems used in surveillance. Comments are due by Sept. 15.Christopher Padilla, IBM’s vice president for government and regulatory affairs, told Reuters the U.S. government should focus on “one to many” systems that could be used to pick dissidents out of a crowd or for mass surveillance, rather than “facial identification” systems that allow a user to unlock an iPhone or board an airplane.IBM said the Commerce Department should control “export of both the high-resolution cameras used to collect data and the software algorithms used to analyze and match that data against a database of images” and argued it should “limit the ability of certain foreign governments to obtain the large-scale computing components required to implement an integrated facial recognition system.”The company’s written comments did not identify specific governments but said “controls on the most powerful types of facial recognition technology should be focused on those countries that have a history of human rights abuses.”The Commerce Department’s July notice said China “has deployed facial recognition technology in the Xinjiang region, in which there has been repression, mass arbitrary detention and high technology surveillance against Uighurs, Kazakhs and other members of Muslim minority groups.”The department has added dozens of Chinese companies and entities to an economic blacklist that it said were implicated in human rights violations regarding China’s treatment of Uighurs, including video surveillance firm Hikvision 002415.SZ, as well as leaders in facial recognition technology SenseTime Group Ltd and Megvii Technology.China has denied mistreating people in Xinjiang.IBM said the Commerce Department should also restrict access to online image databases that can be used to train facial recognition systems.In June, IBM told the U.S. Congress it would stop offering facial recognition software and opposes any use of such technology for purposes of mass surveillance and racial profiling. The company also called for new federal rules to hold police more accountable for misconduct.Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Muralikumar AnantharamanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

       "      <td>- International Business Machines Corp IBM.N is splitting itself into two public companies, capping a years-long effort by the world's first big computing firm to diversify away from its legacy businesses to focus on high-margin cloud computing.IBM will list its IT infrastructure services unit, which provides technical support for 4,600 clients in 115 countries and has a backlog of $60 billion, as a separate company with a new name by the end of 2021.The new company will have 90,000 employees and its leadership structure will be decided in a few months, Chief Financial Officer James Kavanaugh told Reuters.IBM, which currently has more than 352,000 workers, said it expects to record nearly $5 billion in expenses related to the separation and operational changes.Investors cheered the surprise move by Chief Executive Officer Arvind Krishna, the key architect behind IBM’s $34 billion acquisition of cloud company Red Hat last year, sending the company’s shares up 7%.“We divested networking back in the ‘90s, we divested PCs back in the 2000s, we divested semiconductors about five years ago because all of them didn’t necessarily play into the integrated value proposition,” Krishna said on a call with analysts.BIG BLUE’S NEW FOCUSIn a blog, Krishna called the move a “significant shift” in the 109-year-old company’s business model.“IBM is essentially getting rid of a shrinking, low-margin operation given the cannibalizing impact of automation and cloud, masking stronger growth for the rest of the operation,” Wedbush Securities analyst Moshe Katri said.IBM, which has sought to make up for slowing software sales and seasonal demand for its mainframe servers, said it would now focus on open hybrid cloud and AI solutions that will account for more than half of its recurring revenues.Krishna, who replaced Ginni Rometty as CEO in April, said IBM’s software and solutions portfolio would account for the majority of company revenue after the separation.The company also said it expects third-quarter revenue of $17.6 billion and an adjusted profit per share of $2.58, roughly in line with Street estimates.Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Ramakrishnan M.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",

More of my conversations with CEOs are around how they become digital businesses,” Krishna said on a post-earnings call.IBM’s total revenue fell 2.6% to $17.56 billion in the reported quarter, but was slightly above analysts’ estimates of $17.54 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Excluding the impact from currency and business divestitures, sales declined 3.1%.The global technology services segment, IBM’s biggest unit that caters to some of the world’s largest data centers, reported a 4% drop in revenue to $6.5 billion.Excluding items, the company earned $2.58 per share, which was in line with analysts’ estimates.Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru; Editing by Anil D’SilvaOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.</td>\n",
